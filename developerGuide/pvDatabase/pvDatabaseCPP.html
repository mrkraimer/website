<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This document is the guide for pvDatabaseCPP, which is one of the components of
<a href="https://epics-controls.org/resources-and-support/base/epics-7/">
EPICS-7
</a>
</p>

<p>Doxgen for pvDatabase is located at:
<a
href="./html/index.html">doxygen
</a>.
</p>

<p><b>pvDatabase</b> is a framework for implementing a network accessible database of smart memory resident
records.
</p>
<p>
This document is intended for anyone creating new PVRecords.
<a
href="../pvService/pvService.html">pvService
</a>
Describes a good way to create services via PVRecords.
</p>
<h4>PVDatabase Components</h4>
<p><b>pvDatabase</b> has the following components:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>database</dt>
<dd>
The most important components are:
<dl>
    <dt>PVRecord</dt>
      <dd>
      This is a record. It has a <b>PVStructure</b> and a method <b>process</b>, which is what makes it smart.
      </dd>
    <dt>PVDatabase</dt>
      <dd>
      The is a database of PVRecords.
      </dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dt>pvAccess</dt>
<dd>
This has the following:
<dl>
    <dt>ChannelProviderLocal</dt>
      <dd>
      This a ChannelProvider, defined in pvAccess, that provides access to the PVDatabse records.
      </dd>
    <dt>ChannelLocal</dt>
      <dd>
      This provides access to a single PVRecord.
      </dd>  
</dl>
</dd>

<dt>copy</dt>
<dd>
This has the code for pvStructureCopy and all the plugin support.
</dd>

<dt>special</dt>
   <dd>
   PVRecords that can be created by pvDatabase itself.
   A record can be created directly by a client or via iocshell commands.
   </dd>
<dt>support</dt>
   <dd>deprecated</dd>
</dl>

<h2>database</h2>
<p>
This is the code for creating a PVDatabase, which is a database of PVRecords.
</p>
<h3>PVRecord</h3>
<p>
A PVRecord consists of a PVStructure and a set of methods for accessing the record.
The PVStructure has the data for the record.
There is a base class that implements all the methods associated with accessing the record.
But some are virtual and can be implemented by a derived class.
</p>
<p>The virtual methods are:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>process</dt>
   <dd>
   This is the method that makes a record smart.
   Often this is the only method a derived class needs to implement.
   If it encounters errors it should raise alarms and/or
   call the <b>message</b> method provided by the base class.
   If the pvStructure has a top level timeStamp,
   the base class sets the timeStamp to the current time.
   </dd>
   <dt>init</dt>
   <dd>
   A derived class can implement this if finds errors during initilization
   and does not want the record added to the PVDatabase.
   </dd>
   <dt>start</dt>
   <dd>
   This is called before record is added to database.
   </dd>
   <dt>remove</dt>
   <dd>
   Remove the PVRecord. Release any resources used and
   get rid of listeners and requesters.
   If derived class overrides this then it must call PVRecord::remove()
   after it has destroyed any resorces it uses.
   </dd>
   <dt>getService</dt>
   <dd>
   Return a service corresponding to the specified request PVStructure.
   </dd>
</dl>
<p><b>ChannelProviderLocal</b>, described below, allows client to access a record
via the network.
But another record in the same ioc can access the record via the PVDatabase.
For example if the other record wants to put data into the record it must do something like the following:
</p>
<pre>
PVRecordPtr pvr(pvRecord.lock());
if(!pvr) throw std::logic_error("pvRecord is deleted");
try {
    {
        epicsGuard&lt;PVRecord&gt; guard(*pvr);
        pvr->beginGroupPut();
        // put data
        pvr->process();
        pvr->endGroupPut();
    }
} catch(std::exception&amp; ex) {
        // handle error
}
</pre>
<h4>method brief description</h4>
<pre>
The following are virtual methods.
init                 Initialization method.
start                Called before a record is added to database.
