<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The following descibes support that can be attached to a PVRecord.
The support is called each time a record is processed.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/epics-base/exampleCPP">exampleCPP</a>
has an example named <b>support</b>, which demonstrates use of the support
described in this document.
</p>
<p>
The next two sections describe the existing support.
Then follows a description of how to run the support example.
Finally there is a section about how to use the support in services
implemented via pvDatabase.
</p> 
<h2>controlSupport</h2>
<p><b>controlSupport</b> is support for any field that is a numeric scalar.
The following must appear in the same structure as the field being supported:
</p>
<pre>
control_t control
    double limitLow
    double limitHigh
    double minStep
    scalarType outputValue
</pre>
where:
<dl>
  <dt>limitLow</dt>
    <dd>
     When the record is processed and the associated value field is modified,
     the new value is not allowed to be less than limitLow.
    </dd>
  <dt>limitHigh</dt>
    <dd>
     When the record is processed and the associated value field is modified,
     the new value is not allowed to be greater than limitHigh.
    </dd>
  <dt>minStep</dt>
    <dd>
    When to associated value field is changed then
    outputValue is not allowed to change by more then minStep
    each time the the record is processed.
    </dd> 
  <dt>outputValue</dt>
    <dd>
    The current output value. Note that it has the same scalarType as
     the associated value field.
    </dd>
</dl>
<b>NOTES:</b>
<ul>
   <li>
    The limits are ignored if <b>limitHigh&lt;=limitLow</b>
   </li>
   <li>
    minStep is ignored if <b>minStep&lt;=0</b>.
   </li>
</ul>
<h2>scalarAlarmSupport</h2>
<p><b>scalarAlarmSupport</b> is support for any field that is a numeric scalar.
The following must appear in the same structure as the field being supported:
</p>
<pre>
scalarAlarm_t scalarAlarm
    double lowAlarmLimit
    double lowWarningLimit
    double highWarningLimit
    double highAlarmLimit
    double hysteresis
</pre>
where:
<dl>
  <dt>lowAlarmLimit</dt>
    <dd>
     When the record is processed the associated value field is checked
     to see if it is less than lowAlarmLimit.
     If it is the alarm field is set to major alarm.
    </dd>
  <dt>lowWarningLimit</dt>
    <dd>
     When the record is processed the associated value field is checked
     to see if it is less than lowWarningLimit.
     If it is the alarm field is set to minor alarm.
    </dd>
  <dt>highWarningLimit</dt>
    <dd>
     When the record is processed the associated value field is checked
     to see if it is less than highWarningLimit.
     If it is the alarm field is set to minor alarm.
    </dd>
  <dt>highAlarmLimit</dt>
    <dd>
     When the record is processed the associated value field is checked
     to see if it is less than highAlarmLimit.
     If it is the alarm field is set to major alarm.
    </dd>
  <dt>hysteresis</dt>
    <dd>
    If an alarm is raised then it is not set to a lower alarm severity
    until the associated value changes from the current limit by at least
    <b>hysteresis</b>.
    </dd>
</dl>
<b>NOTES:</b>
<ul>
   <li>
   A field named <b>alarm</b> must exists in the same structure as the field being     
   supported and must be standard alarm field.
   </li>
   <li>
    The high limits are ignored if <b>highAlarmLimit&lt;=lowAlarmLimit</b>
   </li>
   <li>
    The warning limits are ignored if <b>highWarningLimit&lt;=lowWarningLimit</b>
   </li>
   <li>
    High limits are checked before warning limits.
   </li>
   <li>
    hysteresis is ignored if <b>hysteresis&lt;=0</b>.
   </li>
</ul>
