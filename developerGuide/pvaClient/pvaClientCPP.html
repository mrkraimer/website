<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This document is the guide for pvaClientCPP, which is one of the components of
<a href="https://epics-controls.org/resources-and-support/base/epics-7/">
EPICS-7
</a>.
<br/>
It is intended for developers that want to use pvaClientCPP.
A guide for developers is available at
<a
href="https://mrkraimer.github.io/website/developerGuide/developerGuide.html">

</a>
</p>
<p>
pvaClient is a synchronous wrapper for the pvAccess API, which is a callback based API.
Thus it is easier to use than pvAccess itself.
In addition pvaClient provides many convenience methods.
</p>

<h2>PvaClient</h2>
<h3>Brief Description</h3>
<p><b>PvaClient</b> has methods:</p>
<pre>
get              get the single instance of PvaClient
channel          creates a channel and connect. This blocks and can throw an exception.
createChannel    create a channel without blocking.
setRequester     set a message requester. Client can optionally call this.
getRequesterName get the requester name,
message          generate a message. Any code can call this.
clearRequester   let pvaClient handle calls to message and getRequesterName
showCache        show the current channels in the cache
cacheSize        show the number of channels in the cache
setDebug         set if debug messages should be generated.
getDebug         get the current debug status
</pre>
<p>
Class <b>PvaClient</b> is a class that is used by all the other pvaClient classes.
An application that uses pvaClient must call:</p>
<pre>
PvaClientPtr pvaClient = PvaClient::get(providers);
</pre>
<p>
before it uses any other pvaClient classes.
</p>
<p>
This is a singleton method, i. e. only one instance of PvaClient is created.
</p>
<p>
<b>pvaClient</b> must not be deleted until the client no longer wants to use any part
of pvaClient.
</p>
<p>
<b>providers</b> is a blank separated set of provider names.
For example:</p>
<pre>
PvaClientPtr pvaClient = PvaClient::get("ca pva");
</pre>
<p>
The providers <b>ca</b> and <b>pva</b> are special.
For each of these a client context is created when the <b>PvaClient</b>
is constructed and the context destroyed when <b>PvaClient</b> is deleted.
</p>
<h3>Requester</h3>
<p>This is a class defined in <b>pvAccessCPP</b>.
It's main method is <b>message</b>, which code calls when it wants to  pass messages to the client.
A client that calls PvaClient::setRequester must implememt this class.
</p>
<p>
It has two methods:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>getRequesterName</dt>
      <dd>
      The client must implement this method.
      The value is up to the client.
      </dd>
    <dt>message</dt>
      <dd>
      This is called whenever any message is being generated.
      If the client does not call PvaClient::setRequester then PvaClient displays the message on stdout.
      </dd>    
</dl>
<h3>Channel Caching</h3>
<p>
<b>PvaClient</b> has a method:
</p>
<pre>
PvaClientChannelPtr channel(
    string const &amp; channelName,
    string const &amp;providerName = "pva",
    double timeOut = 5.0);
</pre>
<p>
This method creates a
<b>PvaClientChannel</b> and then connects to the channel.
</p>
<p>
If a call is successful then multiple calls to the same channelName and providerName
share the same PvaClientChannel, i. e. the PvaClientChannel is cached.
</p>
<p>
<b>pvaClientChannelGet</b> and <b>pvaClientChannelPut</b> also implement caching.
</p>
<p>
For example consider a client that makes multiple calls like:
</p>
<pre>
double value;
value =  pva->channel(channelName)->get()->getData()->getDouble();
...
value =  pva->channel(channelName)->get()->getData()->getDouble();
</pre>
<p>
Only the first call creates a new PvaClientChannel and a new PvaClientGet.
The second call reuses the cached PvaClientChannel and PvaClientGet.
</p>
<h4>PERFORMANCE NOTE:</h4>
<p>
If a client connects to many channels then the
caching methods can cause poor network performance.
</p>
<h3>Non Cached Channels</h3>
<p>
<b>PvaClient</b> has a method:
</p>
<pre>
PvaClientChannelPtr createChannel(
    string const &amp; channelName,
    string const &amp;providerName = "pva");
</pre>
<p>
This method is just creates a new PvaClientChannel and returns it to the caller.
The caller must call the PvaClientChannel connect methods.
</p>

<h2>PvaClientChannel</h2>
<h3>Brief Description</h3>
<p><b>PvaClientChannel</b> has methods:</p>
<pre>
The following are for connecting to a channel.
connect      Calls issueConnect and then waitConnect.
             This blocks and can throw an exception.
issueConnect Issue a connection request and return.
waitConnect  Wait until the channel connects.
             It returns Status, wich shows if channel connects.

The following are for getting data from a channel.
Except for createGet, all can throw an exception.
get             Get a PvaChannelGet from the cache or create a PvaChannelGet and connect.
createGet       Create a PvaChannelGet.
getDouble       Calls get and then get data as a double.
getString       Calls get and then get data as a string.
getDoubleArray  Calls get and then get data as a double array.
getStringArray  Calls get and then get data as a string array.

The following are for putting data to a channel.
Except for createPut, all can throw an exception.
put             Get a PvaChannelPut from the cache or create a PvaChannelPut and connect.
createPut       Create a PvaChannelPut.
putDouble       Put a double to the channel.
putString       Put s string to the channel.
putDoubleArray  Put an array of doubles to the channel.
putStringArray  Put an array of strings to the channel.

The following creates a PvaClientPutGet
createPutGet    Create a PvaChannelPutGet.

The following creates a PvaClientMonitor
monitor        Create a PvaChannelMonitor. Can throw an exception.
createMonitor  Create a PvaChannelMonitor.

The following creates a PvaClientProcess
createProcess  Create a PvaChannelProcess.

The following are for remote procedure calls.
rpc        creates a PvaClientRPC. Can throw an exception.
createRPC  creates a PvaClientRPC. 

The following are convience methods
getChannelName  Get the name of the channel
getChannel      This is the pvAccces channel
showCache       Show what is in the channel cache.
cacheSize       Show the number of channels in the cache.

The following can optionally be called by the client to receive state changes
setStateChangeRequester Specify the client callback.

The following are methods of pvAccess:ChannelRequester
getRequesterName    Get the name of the requester.
message             Generate a message.
channelCreated      Client should never call this.
channelStateChange  Client should never call this.
</pre>
<p>
pvaClientChannel is a synchronous wrapper for the pvAccess::Channel API, which is a callback based API.
Thus it is easier to use than pvAccess::Channel itself.
</p>
<p>An instance of <b>PvaClientChannel</b> connects to a single channel.
An instance can only be created via class <b>PvaClient</b> which has both synchronous methods, which block, and non blocking methods.
The synchrouous methods block until a connection is made to the channel and throw an exception if a 
timeout occurs while trying to make a connection.
The non blocking methods leave connection to the caller.
</p>

<h3>Connect: Blocking vs Non-Blocking </h3>
<p><b>PvaClientChannel</b> has methods:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>connect</dt>
       <dd>
        This calls issueConnect and then waitConnect.
        If waitConnect fails an exception is thrown.
        Since waitConnect is a blocking method so is this.
       </dd>
    <dt>issueConnect</dt>
       <dd>
         This is a request to connect to the channel. This is a non blocking call.
       </dd>
    <dt>waitConnect</dt>
       <dd>
         This waits for the server to respond to issueConnect.
         It blocks until the server responds or a timeout occurs.
       </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Get and Put Caching</h3>
<p>
<b>PvaClientChannel</b> has methods:
</p>
<pre>
PvaClientGetPtr get(std::string const &amp; request);
PvaClientPutPtr put(std::string const &amp; request);
</pre>
<p>
Each of these caches.
For example all calls to <b>get</b> with the same <b>request</b> will share the same
<b>PvaChannelGet</b>
</p>
<p>
For example consider a client that makes multiple calls like:
</p>
<pre>
double value;
value =  pva->channel(channelName)->get()->getData()->getDouble();
...
value =  pva->channel(channelName)->get()->getData()->getDouble();
</pre>
<p>
Only the first call creates a new PvaClientChannel and a new PvaClientGet.
The second call reuses the cached PvaClientChannel and PvaClientGet.
</p>
<h3>PvaClientChannelStateChangeRequester</h3>
<p>
<b>PvaClientChannel</b> has method <b>setStateChangeRequester</b>
<b>PvaClientChannelStateChangeRequester</b> has the single method <b>channelStateChange</b>.
It is called each time the channel connection status changes.
</p>
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b>
The implementation must not call a method that blocks waiting for a response from the server.
It it does the client may be blocked forever.
</p>
<p>
An example of illegal code is:
</p>
<pre>
virtual void channelStateChange(PvaClientChannelPtr const &amp; channel, bool isConnected)
{
    if(isConnected&amp;&amp;!pvaClientPut)
    {
       pvaClientPut  = pvaClientChannel->createPut(request);
       pvaClientPut->connect();
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
This is illegal because the call to <b>connect</b> blocks.
</p>
<p>The following is an example of legal code:
</p>
<pre>
virtual void channelStateChange(PvaClientChannelPtr const &amp; channel, bool isConnected)
{
    if(isConnected&amp;&amp;!pvaClientPut)
    {
       pvaClientPut  = pvaClientChannel->createPut(request);
       pvaClientPut->issueConnect();
    }
}
</pre>
<p>This is legal code because neither <b>createPut</b> or <b>issueConnect</b>
blocks.
</p>

<h2>pvaClientData</h2>
<h3>PvaClientData</h3>
<p>This is a base class for <b>pvaClientGetData</b>, <b>pvaClientPutData</b>, and <b>pvaClientMonitorData</b>

    PvaClientPutGetPtr createPutGet(std::string const &amp; request);
    PvaClientPutGetPtr createPutGet(epics::pvData::PVStructurePtr const &amp;  pvRequest);
...
};
</pre>

<h3>PvaClientPutGetRequester</h3>
<p>This is a virtual class that can be implemented by a client that uses <b>PvaClientPut</b>.
It has the methods:</p>
<pre>
virtual void channelPutGetConnect(
