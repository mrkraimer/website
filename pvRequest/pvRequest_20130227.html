<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><b>pvAccess</b> defines interface <b>Channel</b> which has a number of create methods,
which have a argument <b>pvRequest</b>:</p>
<pre>
    ChannelProcess createChannelProcess(
        ChannelProcessRequester channelProcessRequester,
        PVStructure pvRequest);
    ChannelGet createChannelGet(
        ChannelGetRequester channelGetRequester,
        PVStructure pvRequest);
    ChannelPut createChannelPut(
        ChannelPutRequester channelPutRequester,
        PVStructure pvRequest);
    ChannelPutGet createChannelPutGet(
        ChannelPutGetRequester channelPutGetRequester,
        PVStructure pvRequest);
    ChannelRPC createChannelRPC(
        ChannelRPCRequester channelRPCRequester,
        PVStructure pvRequest);
    ChannelArray createChannelArray(
        ChannelArrayRequester channelArrayRequester,
        PVStructure pvRequest);
    Monitor createMonitor(
        MonitorRequester MonitorRequester,
        PVStructure pvRequest);
}</pre>
<p>A <b>Channel</b> is a connection between a client and a server.
For each create method it is the server that determines how <b>pvRequest</b> should be defined.
The client is expected to know what the server expects.
If the client passes an illegal <b>pvRequest</b> to the server then the server will respond to the create method
with an error message.</p>
<p><b>pvAcccess</b> does <b>not</b> define the format of a <b>pvRequest</b> structure but it does
provide a convenience method:</p>
<pre>
PVStructure createRequest(String request, Requester requester);
</pre>
This creates a <b>pvRequest</b> structure that can be used to communicate with a server that supports
the <b>pcIOC Data Model</b> as defined in the next section.</p>

<p>The pvdata project also defines a standard set of 
<a
href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/alpha/normativeTypes/normativeTypes.html">
normative types</a>,
which are used to pass data between client and server.
The <b>pcIOC Data Model</b> supports the general normative types <b>NTScaler, NTScalarArrray,</b> and <b>NTEnum</b>
Other normative types can define their own convenience methods for creating <b>pvRequest</b> structures to
pass between client and server</b>
The other normative types will not be discussed in this document.</p>

<p>This document is based on material that is currently defined in
<b>pvDataJava.html</b>, <b>pvAcccesJava.html</b>, and <b>pvIOCJava.html</b>.
This document makes pvRequest easier to understand by bringing all the concepts into a single document.
</p>

<h2>pvIOC Data Model</h2>

<h3>Quick Summary</h3>

A pvIOC has a database of smart memory resident records.
Each record has a name, which is what pvAccces calls the channel name.
A record has a top level PVStructure, which holds data that is accessed by clients.
A record is smart because it can be processed which results in calling code attached to the record and optionally
to fields in the record.
In this document the term record is used but the discussion can also apply to servers that provide
access to a top level pvStructure that can be accessed via a channel name but do not implement records.</p>
</p>
<p>The Data Model supports general purpose client tools. A set of structures
are defined that support the data model. A pvAccess server supports the data model if it
follows a few simple guidelines.</p>

<p>The model can briefly be described as follows: Clients access a field named
<b>value</b>, which may be a field in the top level structure of a record or in a
substructure. All other fields in the structure are considered properties of
the value field. The fieldname is the property name. The value is usually a
data field, i.e. a scalar type or an array with the elementType being scalar.
All other fields of the structure support the value. The standard property fields
are <b>timeStamp</b>, <b>alarm</b>, <b>display</b>, and <b>control</b>.</p>
<p>A structure may also have fields other than the standard property fields but these other fields
are normally not of interest to clients and are not used by general purpose client tools.
These additiional fields are normally used by support code that gets called as part of record processing.
</p>

<p>For example the following record has a single <b>value</b> field. The value field
has property fields <b>timeStamp</b>, <b>alarm</b>, and <b>display</b>.
It also has a field <b>valueAlarm</b> which is not of interest to most clients.</p>
<pre>

    double value 0.0
    time_t 1969-12-31 19:00:00.000 userTag 0
    alarm_t alarm
        severity NONE status NONE
        message 
    display_t display
        double limitLow 0.0
        double limitHigh 0.0
        string description Sample Description
        string format %f
        string units volts
    valueAlarm_t valueAlarm
        boolean active true
        double lowAlarmLimit 2.0
        double lowWarningLimit 4.0
        double highWarningLimit 8.0
        double highAlarmLimit 10.0
        int lowAlarmSeverity 2
        int lowWarningSeverity 1
        int highWarningSeverity 1
        int highAlarmSeverity 2
        double hystersis 0.2
</pre>
<p>The following example has three value fields: <b>voltage.value, current.value,</b>
and <b>power.value</b>
The record itself has properties <b>alarm</b> and <b>timeStamp</b>
<b>voltage.value</b> and <b>power.value</b> have no property fields.
<b>current.value</b> has a property fields <b>alarm</b> and <b>display</b>.</p>
<pre>

    structure current
        double value 10.0
        alarm_t alarm

            message highAlarm

            string format 
            string units current
    structure power
        double value 10.0
</pre>

<p>A general purpose client tool might ask for power.value, current.value, or voltage.value.
A more specialized client might be interested in the entire record.
</p>

<p>This data model supports existing EPICS V3 channel access clients. More
powerful or special purpose clients can handle structured data. Such clients
can access a structure. For example a client can ask for an entire record. An
example is swtshell.</p>

<h3>Details about pvIOC Data Model</h3>

<h4>Basic Concept</h4>

<p>A structure follows the pvIOC Data Model if it has a set of fields that have
names and types that support the data model. It can have additional fields,
that can also be considered properties. The following field names have special
meaning, i.e. are properties for general purpose clients.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>value</dt>
    <dd>This is normally defined since most general purpose clients access this
      field. All other fields in the structure support or describe the value
      field. The type can any supported type but is usually one of the
      following:
      <dl>
        <dt>scalar</dt>
          <dd>One of <b>boolean</b>, <b>byte</b>, <b>short</b>,
          <b>int</b>, <b>long</b>, <b>float</b>, <b>double</b>, or <b>string</b></dd>
        <dt>scalar array</dt>
          <dd>An array with the element type being a scalar type</dd>
        <dt>enumerated structure</dt>
          <dd>A structure that has fields named <b>index</b> and
            <b>choices</b>. <b>index</b> is an <b>int</b> that selects a choice.
            <b>choices</b> is an array of strings that
            defines the complete set of choices.</dd>
        <dt>other</dt>
          <dd>Other structures can also be defined if clients and support code
            agree on the meaning. Some examples are: 1) A structure defining a
            2D matrix, 2) A structure defining an image, 3) A structure that
            simulates a remote method, ...</dd>
      </dl>
    </dd>
  <dt>timeStamp</dt>
    <dd>The timeStamp. The type MUST be a timeStamp structure. Also if the
      javaIOC structure does not have a timeStamp then a search up the parent
      tree is made to find a timeStamp.</dd>
  <dt>alarm</dt>
    <dd>The alarm. The type MUST be an alarm structure. </dd>
  <dt>display</dt>
    <dd>A display structure as described below. It provides display
      characteristics for the value field.</dd>
  <dt>control</dt>
    <dd>A control structure as described below. It provides control
      characteristics for the value field.</dd>
  <dt>other</dt>
    <dd>Other standard properties can be defined.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In addition the javaIOC structure can have additional fields that support
the value field but are not recognized by most general purpose client tools.
Typical examples are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>input</dt>
    <dd>A field with support that changes the value field. This can be
      anything. It can be a channel access link. It can obtain a value from
      hardware. Etc.</dd>
  <dt>valueAlarm</dt>
    <dd>A field with support that looks for alarm conditions based on the
    value.</dd>
  <dt>output</dt>
    <dd>A field with support that sends the current value
      somewhere else. This can be anything. It can be a channel access link. It
      can write a value to hardware. Etc.</dd>
  <dt>link, links</dt>
    <dd>A structure field that contains one or more fields that are database or
      channel access links to other records and that do not effect the record
      containing the link field. Thus the database or channel access links are
      either process or output links.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The model allows for device records. A device record has fields that are
structures that support the javaIOC data model. For example a power supply
record can have fields power, voltage, current that each support the javaIOC
data model. </p>
<h3>Definitions for Standard Properties</h3>

<p>The set of structures for standard properties for general purpose client
tools are defined in pvData. These are:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>alarm</dt>
       <dd>A structure that has the fields:
       <pre>
structure alarm
    int severity
    int status
    string message
       </pre>
        An alarm also has associated convenience code for processing and displaying alarms.
        In particular the convenience code provides methods that treat <b>severity</b> and <b>status</b>
        like enumerated values.
       </dd>
    <dt>timeStamp</dt>
       <dd>A structure that has the fields:
       <pre>
structure timeStamp
    long secondsPastEpoch
    int nanoSeconds
    int userTag
       </pre>
        A timeStamp also has associated convenience code for processing and displaying timeStamps..
       </dd>
    <dt>display</dt>
       <dd>A structure that has the fields:
       <pre>
structure display
    double limitLow
    double limitHigh
    string description
    string format
    string units
       </pre>
       </dd>
    <dt>control</dt>
       <dd>A structure that has the fields:
       <pre>
structure control
    double limitLow
    double limitHigh
    double minStep
       </pre>
       </dd>
</dl>
<p>See the documentation for either pvDataJava or pvDataCPP for more details about property fields.</p>

<h2>Create Request</h2>
<h3>Where Defined</h3>
<p><b>pvAccess</b> (both pvAccessJava and pvAccessCPP) have a convenience class with a method createRequest.
For example pvAcccessJava has:</p>
<pre>
public class CreateRequestFactory {
   public static PVStructure createRequest(String request,Requester requester) {
        return CreateRequestImpl.createRequest(request,requester);
    }
}
</pre>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose is to create request structures for accesssing records in a server that supports the pvIOC
data model.
It allows the caller to specify the following:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Global Options</dt>
    <dd>Global options are options that apply to the record itself.</dd>
  <dt>Desired Fields</dt>
     <dd>An arbitrary set of subfields can be selected from the top level structure that holds the
      data in the record.</dd>
  <dt>Field Options</dt>
     <dd>These are options that apply to a subfield from the top level structure that holds the
      data in the record.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> The term record is adapted from pvIOC. A pvIOC has a memory resident database of <b>smart</b>
records. A pvAcccess channel is a connection to a record. A record has a top level PVStructure that holds the
data for the record.
A pvAcccess server can be implemented that does not use the pvIOC model but it must provide top level
PVStructures to which a pvAcccess Channel can be attached.
If the server uses that pvIOC Data Model then createRequest can also be used for this type of server.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>A request argument has the syntax:</p>
<pre>
record[option,...]field(fieldDef,...)putField(fieldDef,...)getField(fieldDef,...)
OR
fieldDef,...
</pre>

<p>Thus a request consists of record options and sets of field definitions or
just field definitions. A record option is of the form:</p>
<pre>
record[name=value,...]
</pre>

<p>A field,putFeld,getField is a comma separated set of fieldDefs which are of
the form:</p>
<pre>
fullFieldName
or 
fullFieldName[option,...]
or 
fullFieldName{request}     // recursive definition
</pre>

<p>A fullFieldName is the full name of a field in the PVRecord. The name in a
generated data structure will have just the field name. If
<b>fieldName{request}</b> is given then the generated data structure will have
a structure field with subfields. Note that request is a recursive
definition.</p>

<p>If request is null or an empty string than the entire PVRecord is
selected.</p>

<p>The syntax was chosen to be easy to use and to parse:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>record[]</dt>
      <dd>
      Specifies a set of global options, i. e., options that apply to the record itself. 
      </dd>
   <dt>field()</dt>
   <dt>putField()</dt>
   <dt>getField()</dt>
      <dd>
      Each selects a set of subfields of the top level structure.
      Each defines a comma separated set of <b>fieldDef</b>s.
      </dd>
   <dt>fieldDef</dt>
     <dd>Selects a single subfield of the current structure.</dd>
   <dt>option</dt>
      <dd>
      A <b>name=value</b> pair. Both <b>name</b> and <b>value</b> are character strings.
      </dd>
   <dt>[]</dt>
      <dd>
      Holds a comma separated set of <b>option</b>s.
      </dd>
   <dt>{}</dt>
      <dd>
      Selects a set of subfields of a substructure within the top level structure.
      Each defines a comma separated set of <b>fieldDef</b>s.
      This is a recursive definition.
      Thus a <b>fullFieldName</b> within <b>{}</b> is relative to structure that is referenced
      by <b>{}</b>.
      </dd>
</dl>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>A Java client can create a request as follows:</p>
<pre>
PVStructure pvRequest = CreateRequestFactory.createRequest(request,requester);
</pre>

<p><b>NOTE</b>: The full path is
org.epics.pvaccess.client.CreateRequestFactory.</p>
<p>A C++ client calls:</p>
<pre>
epics::pvData::PVStructure::shared_pointer pvRequest = getCreateRequest()-&gt;createRequest(request,requester);
</pre>
<p>For both Java and C++:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>request</dt>
   <dd>A <b>string</b>.
      The syntax is what is described above.
   </dd>
  <dt>requester</dt>
     <dd>A <b>Requester</b> object. See <b>pvAcccesJava.html</b> or <b>pvAccessCPP.html</b> for details.
     </dd>
</dl>

<h4>Simple Requests</h4>

<p>Clients like CSS, Synoptic Displays, Alarm, and Archive tools only want access to
some combination of the following fields: <b>value</b>, <b>alarm</b>, <b>timeStamp</b>, <b>display</b>, and
<b>control</b>. If the request is for a record that has these all as top level fields
the request string is just a comma separated list of the field names. For
example:</p>
<pre>
"value,alarm,timeStamp"
</pre>

<p>If the record is does not have the desired field at the top level then the
field can still be accessed. For example:</p>
<pre>
"alarm,timeStamp,power.value"
</pre>

<p>Will get the top level alarm and timeStamp and the value from a
structure named power. Thus the above works for a record that is structured as
follows:</p>
<pre>powerSupply
    alarm
    timeStamp
    power
       value
       display
       ...
    ...</pre>

<p>The only option most clients want is to request that a record be processed
as part of a get or put requests. This is done via requests like the
following:</p>
<pre>
"record[process=true]field(value,alarm,timeStamp)"
</pre>

<h4>Power Supply Example</h4>

<p>The following examples are for a power supply record:</p>
<pre>
powerSupply
    alarm
    timeStamp
    power
       value
       alarm
       .. other fields
    voltage
       value
       alarm
       .. other fields
    current
       value
       alarm
       .. other fields
    .. other fields
</pre>


<p>The following request:</p>
<pre>
"field(alarm,timeStamp,power.value)"
</pre>

<p>Will return to the client the following:</p>
<pre>
record psSimple
    alarm_t alarm
        severity NONE status NONE
        message null
    time_t 2013-02-27 06:04:30.997 userTag 0
    double value 10.0
</pre>

<p>Note that if the actual record does not have a requested field than it will
not be present in the structure returned to the client.</p>

<p>The following is the same except that a record option and an option for the
value field will be given.</p>
<pre>
"record[process=true]field(alarm,timeStamp,power.value[shareData=true])"
</pre>

<p>The options are to process the record and to share the value data with the
power.value field in the PVRecord.</p>


<p>The following:</p>
<pre>
"field(alarm,timeStamp,power{value,alarm},current{value,alarm},voltage{value,alarm})"
</pre>

<p>Will return to the client the following:</p>
<pre>
record psEmbeded
    alarm_t alarm
        severity NONE status NONE
        message 
    time_t 1969-12-31 19:00:00.000 userTag 0
    structure power
        double value 0.0
    structure current
        double value 0.0
        alarm_t alarm
            severity NONE status NONE
            message 
    structure voltage
        double value 0.0
        alarm_t alarm
            severity NONE status NONE
            message 
</pre>

<h2>pvIOCJava: pvAccessServer</h2>
<p>This section describes how <b>org.epics.pvioc.pvAccess.ChannelServerFactory</b>
implements the create methods of the <b>pvAccess Channel</b> interface.
This is the code that allows a client to access records in a pvIOC.
In particular it describes how it interpets the <b>PVRequest request</b> argument of the various
create methods.
Thus section can also be used as an example for other pvAccess servers.
</p>
<p>Before discussing the various channel methods it is first necessary to discuss two other
facilities provided by pvIOCJava: <b>pvCopy</b> and <b>monitor</b>.
After these are discussed the various channel create methods are discussed.

<h3>pvCopy</h3>

<p>This package provides support for copying data between a client and
server. It allows a client to access an arbitrary set of fields of a
record that exists on the server. This package does not itself
transfer the data between client and server but provides support for code
that does, e. g. it is used by <b>ChannelServerFactory</b>.</p>

<p>pvCopy supports the complete <b>fieldDef</b> syntax described above,
i. e. it supports:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>A copy of fields from a record</dt>
    <dd>It creates a top level structure that holds a copy of an arbitrary
    set of fields in the top level structure of a record.
    It provides methods to copy values between the two structures.
    It copies only the values that have changed since the last copy request.
    </dd>
  <dt>field options</dt>
    <dd>
    It supports field options. It directly supports the option <b>shareData=true</b>,
    which can be used to share the raw data for scalar arrays rather than creating storage
    for a copy.
    It also makes other field options available to other code, e. g. monitor.
    </dd>
    
</dl>

<h3>monitor</h3>
<p>This is a facility used to monitor changes in a record.
It uses the pvCopy facility and also provides two additional features:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>Monitor Queue</dt>
    <dd>It can keep a queue of structures maintained by pvCopy.
    The client can specify the queue size via a record option, e. g.
   <b>record[queueSize=2]</b>.
   <dt>Monitor Algorithms</dt>
    <dd>It supports the ability to implement monitor algorithms. It has an implementation
     of the following: <b>onPut</b>, <b>onChange</b>, <b>deadband</b>, and <b>periodic</b>. 
    For <b>periodic</b> it supports the record option <b>record[periodicRate=rate]</b>.
    It also supports the creation of other monitoring algorithms.
    It supports field options to specify values for monitor algorithms.
    For example <b>value[algorithm=onChange,causeMonitor=true]</b>
    See pvIOCJava for details.
    </dd>
</dl>


<h3>ChannelProcess</h3>
<p>The request argument is ignored.</p>


<h3>ChannelGet and ChannelPut</h3>
<p>The request string has the form:</p>
<pre>
"record[options]field(fieldOptions)"
</pre>
<p>An example of a record option is <b>process=true</b>.
The fieldOptions are as defined by pvCopy.</p>

<h3>ChannelPutGet</h3>
<p>The request string has the form:</p>
<pre>
"record[options]putField(fieldOptions)getField(fieldOptions)"
</pre>
<p>An example of a record option is <b>process=true</b>.
The fieldOptions are as defined by pvCopy.</p>
<p><b>pvIOCJava</b> has a set of records with associated support that implement a remote procedure
model intended to be accessed via channelPutGet.
These records have a substructure <b>arguments</b> and a substructure <b>result</b>.
The client is expected to use the request string:</p>
<pre>
"record[process=true]putField(arguments)getField(result)"
</pre>
<p>The details of <b>arguments</b> and <b>result</b> depend on the support.
The client makes a putGet request by setting values in <b>arguments</b> and gets the result from <b>result</b>.
</p>
<p>An example is a record that has support for getting a string array where each element is the
name of a record in the IOC. The argument has a single subfield named <b>regularExpression</b>,
which is a grep style string.
An example record is:</p>
<pre>
record laptoprecordListPGRPC
    structure arguments
        string regularExpression .*Double
    structure result
        string status success
        string[] names [scalarDouble,arrayDouble]
</pre>
<p>In this case the client gave an expression <b>.*Double</b>
which found all records with names that ended with <b>Double</b>.
For this IOC there were two records <b>scalarDouble</b> and <b>arrayDouble</b>.

<h3>ChannelRPC</h3>
<p>pvIOCJava has only a simple example of support for <b>channelRPC</b>, which does not use pvRequest.
<p>channelRPC is mostly used to implement services.
Most services use normative types for both the argument passed to request and for the structure
returned by a request. For example a <b>NTNameValue</b> for the argument and <b>NTTable</b> for the result.
Thus createRequest will not normally be used by channelRPC services.</p>

<h3>ChannelArray</h3>
<p>The request string has the form:</p>
<pre>
"field(fieldDef)"
</pre>
<p>FieldDef must refer to a subfield of the top level structure that has type <b>scalarArray</b>
or <b>structureArray</b>.
It it does not then an error is returned to the client.</p>

<h3>Monitor</h3>
<p>The request string has the form:</p>
<pre>
"record[options]field(fieldOptions)"
</pre>
<p><b>options</b> and <b>fieldOptions</b> are those defined above for monitor.</p>

<h2>pvaSrv</h2>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> pvaSrv is under development by Ralph Lange.
Thus this is just some comments about how pvRequest could be handled by pvaSrv.
Details <b>will</b> change. For example Ralph already has plans to rename multiChannel
and change it's functionality.
</p>
<p>pvaSrv currently has two pvAcccess servers: v3Channel and multiChannel.</p>
<h3>v3Channel</h3>
<p>This is a pvAcccess server for accessing records in an EPICS base IOC.
A channel is a single V3 record.
v3Channel supports all the Channel create methods except ChannelPutGet and ChannelRPC.
For the others it supports the pvIOC Data Model.
Thus a pvRequest can be created via createRequest as described above.
A V3 record has a "flat" structure so it appears as a structure of the following type:</p>
<pre>
structure
    &lt;someType&gt; value
    structure alarm
    structure timeStamp
    structure display
    structure control
</pre>
<p>The v3Channel implemantation takes care of all conversions from the way V3 records are implemented
and the pcIOC Data model.</p>
<h3>multiChannel</h3>
<p>Since this is a work in progress only a brief comment will be made.
The support could be implemented so that it supports the pvIOCData Model, i. e. so that
the client can use createRequest to create pvRequest structures.
It is not clear if this is desirable. It may be better to provide custom support for creating
the pvRequest structures that are easier for clients to use.</p>

<h2>Syntax for pvRequest structure created by createRequest</h2>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> This section is only of interest to someone who is implementing code that
has to introspect a structure generated by createRequest.</p>

<p>pvRequest is a PVStructure that describes 1) record options and 2) field
requests and options. It has the following structure:</p>
<pre>
structure
  structure record
    structure _options
      option
      ...
  structure field
    structure fieldName
      structure _options
        option
        ...
      structure fieldName
        structure _options
          option
          ...
        ...  
  structure putField
    structure fieldName
      structure _options
        option
        ...
      structure fieldName
        structure _options
          option
          ...
        ...  
  structure getField
    structure fieldName
      structure _options
        option
        ...
      structure fieldName
        structure _options
          option
          ...
        ...  
</pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
  <dt>record</dt>
    <dd>The options that apply to the entire record.</dd>
  <dt>option</dt>
    <dd>This is of the form 
      <b>string &lt;name&gt; &lt;value&gt;</b>
    </dd>
  <dt>field</dt>
    <dd>Definitions that select fields of the PVRecord and options for the
      fields. This definition is recursive.</dd>
  <dt>fieldName</dt>
    <dd>The field name that will appear in the PVStructure that is a copy of
      the fields selected from the PVRecord. </dd>
</dl>

<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The definition is recursive , i.e. an arbitarily complex structure can be
    defined.</li>
  <li>If a pvRequest with no fields is specified than all fields if the target
    PVRecord will appear in the PVCopy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Two examples of options are process and shareData.</p>

<p>Process is a record option:</p>
<pre>
structure
  structure record
    structure _options
      string process true
   
</pre>

<p>For example if process is an option to createGet then the record will be
processed before data is fetched. NOTE: scalarType boolean is also
supported.</p>

<p>The following is an example of a field option:</p>
<pre>
structure 
    structure field
        structure value
            structure _options
                string shareData true
</pre>
<p>This is a request to share the actual data rather than creating a copy.</p>

<p>Some examples are:</p>
<pre>
request 
structure 

request alarm,timeStamp,power.value
structure 
    structure alarm
    structure timeStamp
    structure power
        structure value

request record[process=true]field(alarm,timeStamp,power.value)
structure 
    structure record
        structure _options
            string process true
    structure field
        structure alarm
        structure timeStamp
        structure power
            structure value

request record[process=true]field(alarm,timeStamp[algorithm=onChange,causeMonitor=false],power{value,alarm})
structure 
    structure record
        structure _options
            string process true
    structure field
        structure alarm
        structure timeStamp
            structure _options
                string algorithm onChange
                string causeMonitor false
        structure power
            structure value
            structure alarm

request record[process=true,xxx=yyy]field(alarm,timeStamp[shareData=true],power.value)
structure 
    structure record
        structure _options
            string process true
            string xxx yyy
    structure field
        structure alarm
        structure timeStamp
            structure _options
                string shareData true
        structure power
            structure value
