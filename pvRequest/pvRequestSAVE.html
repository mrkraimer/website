<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>pvAccess: pvRequest argument</h3>
<p><b>pvAccess</b> defines interface <b>Channel</b> which has a number of create methods.
<br />
Each has an argument <b>pvRequest</b>:</p>
<pre>
NOTE: The following uses Java syntax
ChannelProcess createChannelProcess(
    ChannelProcessRequester channelProcessRequester,
    PVStructure pvRequest);
ChannelGet createChannelGet(
    ChannelGetRequester channelGetRequester,
    PVStructure pvRequest);
ChannelPut createChannelPut(
    ChannelPutRequester channelPutRequester,
    PVStructure pvRequest);
ChannelPutGet createChannelPutGet(
    ChannelPutGetRequester channelPutGetRequester,
    PVStructure pvRequest);
ChannelRPC createChannelRPC(
    ChannelRPCRequester channelRPCRequester,
    PVStructure pvRequest);
ChannelArray createChannelArray(
    ChannelArrayRequester channelArrayRequester,
    PVStructure pvRequest);
Monitor createMonitor(
    MonitorRequester MonitorRequester,
    PVStructure pvRequest);
</pre>
<p>A <b>Channel</b> is a connection between a client and a server.
For each create method, the server look at <b>pvRequest</b>
and decides how to implement the clients request.
If the client passes an illegal pvRequest the server can respond to the create method
with an error message.</p>
<h3>Brief History of pvRequest</h3>
<p>In 2006 a project named <b>javaIOC</b> was started by Marty Kraimer.
Shortly after Matej Sekoranja also started working on this project.
Until about 2000, they were the only <b>javaIOC</b> developers.
The pvAccess API was one of the first projects.
How to pass client requests to the  server was a big issue until we realized that pvData supports
structured data.
So there was a single argument for passing client requests to the server, i.e.
</p>
<pre>
PVStructure pvRequest
</pre>
<p><b>pvRequest</b> allows a client to pass structured data to the server.
But without something more how would servers and tool know what to do with what is in
a pvRequest structure.
This a facility <b>CreateRequest</b> was created.
It takes an ascii string and from it creates a pvRequest structure.
</p>
<p>
In about 2000 work started on a C++ implementation of what was in the javaIOC.
At this time more people became involved with develpment.
This is now what is called the <b>V4</b> modules in <b>EPICS 7</b>
</p>
<h3>CreateRequest</h3>
<p><b>pvAcccess</b> does not define the format of a <b>pvRequest</b> structure but <b>pvData</b> does
provide a convenience method:</p>
<pre>
PVStructure createRequest(String request);
</pre>
This creates a <b>pvRequest</b> structure that can be used to communicate with a server that supports
the <b>pvIOC Data Model</b> as defined in a following section.</p>

<p>
pvDataCPP and pvDataJava both implement <b>CreateRequest</b> ,which can be used by a client
to create a pvRequest structure that can be passed to the channel create methods.
<p/>
<p>
A pvRequest structure allows a client to select:
<h4>An arbitrary set of fields.</h4>
<p>When a client connects to  channel, it receives a the Structure that describes the
top level PVStructure the channel supports.
From the Structure, or just by anticipating what the server supports,
the client can select the fields it wants to use.
</p>
<h4>Global and field specific options</h4>
<p>The client can pass global or field specific options to the server.
An option is just a name,value pair.
</p>
<h4>examples</h4>
<pre>
mrk> pvget -r "" -i PVRdouble   // "" means entire PVStructure
PVRdouble
epics:nt/NTScalar:1.0 
    double value 0
    alarm_t alarm
        int severity 0
        int status 0
        string message 
    time_t timeStamp
        long secondsPastEpoch 0
        int nanoseconds 0
        int userTag 0
mrk> pvget -r "value" -i PVRdouble
PVRdouble
structure 
    double value 0
mrk> pvget -r "record[process=true]field(value,timeStamp)" -i PVRdouble
PVRdouble
structure 
    double value 0
    time_t timeStamp
        long secondsPastEpoch 1533581620
        int nanoseconds 697865085
        int userTag 0
</pre>




<h2>OLD</h2>


<p>The pvdata project also defines a standard set of 
<a
href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/alpha/normativeTypes/normativeTypes.html">
normative types</a>,
which are used to pass data between client and server.
The <b>pcIOC Data Model</b> supports the general normative types <b>NTScaler, NTScalarArrray,</b> and <b>NTEnum</b>
Other normative types could define their own convenience methods for creating <b>pvRequest</b> structures to
pass between client and server.
However this should not be done unless there is a real need
since it means new conventions on both the client and server.

</dl>

<p>
This document makes pvRequest easier to understand by bringing all the concepts into a single document.
</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>pvAccess provides the ability to pass structured data between clients and servers.
Since the data can be quite complex it could be very difficult for clients to use.
Lets consider a few typical types of clients.</p>
<h3>General Purpose Tools</h3>
<p>Think of tools like those provided by CSS/BOY/pvManager.
Thus strip chart , alarm display, slider, etc.
These types of tools want data like EPICS base provides.
Thus some combination of value, alarm, timeStamp, display, and control information.
Such tools want data that follows the pvIOC Data Model described in the next section.
Note that both pvaSrv, pvIOCJava, and pvDatabaseCPP all support this model.
</p>
<h3>channelPutGet services</h3>
<p>A service that is implemented via a channelPutGet request could provide data via a structure like:</p>
<pre>
structure recordName
    structure argument
       // details are service specific
    structure result
       // details are service specific
</pre>
where
<dl>
   <dt>argument</dt>
     <dd>Data sent by client</dd>
   <dt>result</dt>
     <dd>Data returned to the client from the service.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In this case the client could just say that it wants <b>"putField(argument),getField(result)"</b>
With the facilities described below the user can do this.
Note that swtshellJava provides a GUI tool that allows a client to make such a request.</p>
<h3>Normative Type Suppport</h3>
<p>There is automatic support for some normative types like NTScalar and NTArray.
Other normative types could provide helper code that either uses the conventions and support described
in this document or invent their own support for creating a pvRequest.</p>
<h3>Other Specialized Support</h3>
<p>For specialized support it is always possible to create private conventions for pvRequest.
But then general pupose tools will be much less useful
and it may also be necessary for the support to implement various Channel methods.</p>


<h2>Create Request</h2>
<h3>Where Defined</h3>
<p><b>pvAccess</b> (both pvAccessJava and pvAccessCPP) have a convenience class with a method createRequest.
For example pvAcccessJava has:</p>
<pre>
public class CreateRequestFactory {
   public static PVStructure createRequest(String request);{
}
</pre>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose is to create a pvRequest structures for accesssing data in a server.
It allows the clients to select an arbitrary subset of the fields in the top level structure
associated with the channel.
It also allows the client to specify options.
Thus the client can specify:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Global Options</dt>
    <dd>Global options are options that apply to the record itself.</dd>
  <dt>Desired Fields</dt>
     <dd>An arbitrary set of fields can be selected from the top level structure that holds the
      data in the record.</dd>
  <dt>Field Options</dt>
     <dd>These are options that apply to a selected field.
      </dd>
</dl>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> The term record is adapted from pvDatabase. A pvDatabase has a memory resident database of <b>smart</b>
records. A pvAcccess channel is a connection to a record. A record has a top level PVStructure that holds the
data for the record.
A pvAcccess server can be implemented that does not use the pvDatabase model but it must provide top level
PVStructures to which a pvAcccess Channel can be attached.
<b>pvaSrv</b>, which provides access to iocCore V3 records, is an example that also accepts a pvRequest
created by a call to createRequest.
</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>A request argument has the syntax:</p>
<pre>
record[option,...]field(fieldDef,...)putField(fieldDef,...)getField(fieldDef,...)
OR
fieldDef,...
</pre>

<p>Thus a request consists of record options and sets of field definitions or
just field definitions. A record option is of the form:</p>
<pre>
record[name=value,...]
</pre>

<p>A field,putFeld,getField is a comma separated set of fieldDefs which are of
the form:</p>
<pre>
fullFieldName
or 
fullFieldName[option,...]
or 
fullFieldName{request}     // recursive definition
</pre>

<p>A fullFieldName is the full name of a field in the PVRecord. The name in a
generated data structure will have just the field name. If
<b>fieldName{request}</b> is given then the generated data structure will have
a structure field with subfields. Note that request is a recursive
definition.</p>

<p>If request is null or an empty string than the entire top level structure of the PVRecord is
selected.</p>

<p>The syntax was chosen to be easy to use and to parse:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>record[]</dt>
      <dd>
      Specifies a set of global options, i. e., options that apply to the record itself. 
      </dd>
   <dt>field()</dt>
   <dt>putField()</dt>
   <dt>getField()</dt>
      <dd>
      Each selects a set of subfields of the top level structure.
      Each defines a comma separated set of <b>fieldDef</b>s.
      </dd>
   <dt>fieldDef</dt>
     <dd>Selects a single subfield of the current structure.</dd>
   <dt>option</dt>
      <dd>
      A <b>name=value</b> pair. Both <b>name</b> and <b>value</b> are character strings.
      </dd>
   <dt>[]</dt>
      <dd>
      Holds a comma separated set of <b>option</b>s.
      </dd>
   <dt>{}</dt>
      <dd>
      Selects a set of subfields of a substructure within the top level structure.
      Each defines a comma separated set of <b>fieldDef</b>s.
      This is a recursive definition.
      Thus a <b>fullFieldName</b> within <b>{}</b> is relative to structure that is referenced
      by <b>{}</b>.
      </dd>
</dl>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>A Java client can create a request as follows:</p>
<pre>
PVStructure pvRequest = CreateRequestFactory.createRequest(request);
</pre>

<p><b>NOTE</b>: The full path is
org.epics.pvaccess.client.CreateRequestFactory.</p>
<p>A C++ client calls:</p>
<pre>
epics::pvData::PVStructurePtr pvRequest = CreateRequest::create()-&gt;createRequest(request);
</pre>
<p>For both Java and C++:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>request</dt>
   <dd>A <b>string</b>.
      The syntax is what is described above.
   </dd>
</dl>

<h4>Simple Records</h4>

<p>Clients like CSS, Synoptic Displays, Alarm, and Archive tools only want access to
some combination of the following fields: <b>value</b>, <b>alarm</b>, <b>timeStamp</b>, <b>display</b>, and
<b>control</b>. If the request is for a record that has these all as top level fields
the request string is just a comma separated list of the field names. For
example:</p>
<pre>
"value,alarm,timeStamp"
</pre>

<p>If the record is does not have the desired field at the top level then the
field can still be accessed but in this case the full structure is preserved.
For example:</p>
<pre>
"alarm,timeStamp,power.value"
</pre>

<p>Will get the top level alarm and timeStamp and the value from a
structure named power. Thus the above works for a record that is structured as
follows:
<pre>powerSupply
    alarm
    timeStamp
    power
       value
       display
       ...
    ...
</pre>
What is returned to the client is:
<pre>powerSupply
    alarm
    timeStamp
    power
       value
</pre>
</p>

<p>The only option most clients want is to request that a record be processed
as part of a get or put requests. This is done via requests like the
following:</p>
<pre>
"record[process=true]field(value,alarm,timeStamp)"
</pre>

<h4>Power Supply Example</h4>

<p>The following examples are for a power supply record:</p>
<pre>
powerSupply
    alarm
    timeStamp
    power
       value
       alarm
       .. other fields
    voltage
       value
       alarm
       .. other fields
    current
       value
       alarm
       .. other fields
    .. other fields
</pre>


<p>The following request:</p>
<pre>
"field(alarm,timeStamp,power.value)"
</pre>

<p>Will return to the client the following:</p>
<pre>
record psSimple
    alarm_t alarm
        severity NONE status NONE
        message null
    time_t 2013-02-27 06:04:30.997 userTag 0
    structure power
        double value 10.0
</pre>

<p>Note that if the actual record does not have a requested field than it will
not be present in the structure returned to the client.
</p>

<p>The following is the same except that a record option and an option for the
value field will be given.</p>
<pre>
"record[process=true]field(alarm,timeStamp,power.value[monitorAlgorithm=onChange])"
</pre>

<p>The options are to process the record and to cause power.value to cause a monitor only if the value changes.</p>


<p>The following:</p>
<pre>
"field(alarm,timeStamp,power{value,alarm},current{value,alarm},voltage{value,alarm})"
</pre>

<p>Will return to the client the following:</p>
<pre>
record psEmbeded
    alarm_t alarm
        severity NONE status NONE
        message 
    time_t 1969-12-31 19:00:00.000 userTag 0
    structure power
        double value 0.0
    structure current
        double value 0.0
        alarm_t alarm
            severity NONE status NONE
            message 
    structure voltage
        double value 0.0
        alarm_t alarm
            severity NONE status NONE
            message 
</pre>

<h2>pvIOCJava and pvDatabaseCPP</h2>
<p>
pvIOCJava and pvDatabaseCPP both implement a local channel provider,
e. g. each implements both ChannelProvider and Channel.
A client can connect directly to the local channel provider or via remote pvAccess.
</p>
<p>
The local provider implements the create methods of the <b>pvAccess Channel</b> interface.
This section describes the syntax of the request passed <b>createRequest(request)</b>
that creates a valid pvRequest structure.
</p>
<h3>ChannelProcess</h3>
<p>The request argument is ignored.</p>


<h3>ChannelGet and ChannelPut</h3>
<p>The request string has the form:</p>
<pre>
"record[options]field(fieldDef,...)"
</pre>
<p>An example of a record option is <b>process=true</b>.
The default for channelGet is <b>process=false</b> and for channelPut <b>process=true</b>.
fieldDef is defined in the previous section.
</p>

<h3>ChannelPutGet</h3>
<p>The request string has the form:</p>
<pre>
"record[options]putField(fieldDef,...)getField(fieldDef,...)"
</pre>
<p>An example of a record option is <b>process=false</b>.
The default is <b>process=true</b>.
fieldDef is defined in the previous section.
</p>
<p><b>pvIOCJava</b> has a set of records with associated support that implement a remote procedure
model intended to be accessed via channelPutGet.
These records have a substructure <b>argument</b> and a substructure <b>result</b>.
The client is expected to use the request string:</p>
<pre>
"record[process=true]putField(argument)getField(result)"
</pre>
<p>The details of <b>argument</b> and <b>result</b> depend on the support.
The client makes a putGet request by setting values in <b>argument</b> and gets the result from <b>result</b>.
</p>
<p>An example is a record that has support for getting a string array where each element is the
name of a record in a pvIOCJava. The argument has a single subfield named <b>regularExpression</b>,
which is a grep style string.
An example record is:</p>
<pre>
record laptoprecordListPGRPC
    structure argument
        string regularExpression .*Double
    structure result
        string status success
        string[] names [scalarDouble,arrayDouble]
</pre>
<p>In this case the client gave an expression <b>.*Double</b>
which finds all records with names that ended with <b>Double</b>.
For this IOC there were two records <b>scalarDouble</b> and <b>arrayDouble</b>.

<h3>ChannelRPC</h3>
<p>This is used by many services that are part of V4.
Each service can optionally use pvRequest.
There is no support for channelRPC in pvIOCJava or pvDatabaseCPP.
pvAccess does have support for a service that is implemented via channelRPC.
Most services use normative types for both the argument passed to request and for the structure
returned by a request. For example a <b>NTNameValue</b> for the argument and <b>NTTable</b> for the result.
Thus createRequest will not normally be used by channelRPC services.</p>

<h3>ChannelArray</h3>
<p>The request string has the form:</p>
<pre>
"field(fieldDef)"
</pre>
<p>FieldDef must refer to a subfield of the top level structure that has type <b>scalarArray</b>
or <b>structureArray</b>.
It it does not then an error is returned to the client.</p>

<h3>Monitor</h3>
<p>The request string has the form:</p>
<pre>
"record[options]field(fieldDef,...)"
</pre>
<p><b>options</b> is server specific and will not be discussed here.
fieldDef is defined in the previous section.
</p>

<h2>pvaSrv</h2>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> pvaSrv is under development by Ralph Lange.
This section only describes the pvRequest for accessing individual V3 records.
</p>
<p>pvaSrv implements a pvAcccess server for accessing records in an EPICS base IOC.
A channel is a single V3 record.
All the Channel create methods except ChannelPutGet and ChannelRPC are supported.
A pvRequest can be created via createRequest as described above.
A V3 record has a "flat" structure so it appears as a structure of the following type:</p>
<pre>
structure
    &lt;someType&gt; value
    structure alarm
    structure timeStamp
    structure display
    structure control
</pre>
<p>The v3Channel implemantation takes care of all conversions from the way V3 records are implemented
and a top level PVStructure that a pvAccess client expects.
</p>

<h2>pvIOC Data Model</h2>

<h3>Quick Summary</h3>

<p>A pvIOC has a database of smart memory resident records.
Each record has a name, which is what pvAccces calls the channel name.
A record has a top level PVStructure, which holds data that is accessed by clients.
A record is smart because it can be processed which results in calling code attached to the record and optionally
to fields in the record.
In this document the term record is used but the discussion can also apply to servers that provide
access to a top level pvStructure that can be accessed via a channel name but do not implement records.</p>
</p>
<p>The Data Model supports general purpose client tools. A set of structures
are defined that support the data model. A pvAccess server supports the data model if it
follows a few simple guidelines.</p>

<p>The model can briefly be described as follows: Clients access a field named
<b>value</b>, which may be a field in the top level structure of a record or in a
substructure. All other fields in the structure are considered properties of
the value field. The fieldname is the property name. The value is usually a
data field, i.e. a scalar type or an array with the elementType being scalar.
All other fields of the structure support the value. The standard property fields
are <b>timeStamp</b>, <b>alarm</b>, <b>display</b>, and <b>control</b>.</p>
<p>A structure may also have fields other than the standard property fields but these other fields
are normally not of interest to clients and are not used by general purpose client tools.
These additiional fields are normally used by support code as part of record processing.
</p>

<p>For example the following record has a single <b>value</b> field. The value field
has property fields <b>timeStamp</b>, <b>alarm</b>, and <b>display</b>.
It also has a field <b>valueAlarm</b> which is not of interest to most clients.</p>
<pre>

<p>This data model supports existing EPICS V3 channel access clients. More
powerful or special purpose clients can handle structured data. Such clients
can access a structure. For example a client can ask for an entire record. An
example is swtshell.</p>

<h3>Details about pvIOC Data Model</h3>

<h4>Basic Concept</h4>

<p>A structure follows the pvIOC Data Model if it has a set of fields that have
names and types that support the data model. It can have additional fields,
that can also be considered properties. The following field names have special
meaning, i.e. are properties for general purpose clients.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>value</dt>
    <dd>This is normally defined since most general purpose clients access this
      field. All other fields in the structure support or describe the value
      field. The type can any supported type but is usually one of the
      following:
      <dl>
        <dt>scalar</dt>
          <dd>One of <b>boolean</b>, <b>byte</b>, <b>short</b>,
          <b>int</b>, <b>long</b>, <b>float</b>, <b>double</b>, or <b>string</b></dd>
        <dt>scalar array</dt>
          <dd>An array with the element type being a scalar type</dd>
        <dt>enumerated structure</dt>
          <dd>A structure that has fields named <b>index</b> and
            <b>choices</b>. <b>index</b> is an <b>int</b> that selects a choice.
            <b>choices</b> is an array of strings that
            defines the complete set of choices.</dd>
        <dt>other</dt>
          <dd>Other structures can also be defined if clients and support code
            agree on the meaning. Some examples are: 1) A structure defining a
            2D matrix, 2) A structure defining an image, 3) A structure that
            simulates a remote method, ...</dd>
      </dl>
    </dd>
  <dt>timeStamp</dt>
    <dd>The timeStamp. The type MUST be a timeStamp structure. Also if the
      javaIOC structure does not have a timeStamp then a search up the parent
      tree is made to find a timeStamp.</dd>
  <dt>alarm</dt>
    <dd>The alarm. The type MUST be an alarm structure. </dd>
  <dt>display</dt>
    <dd>A display structure as described below. It provides display
      characteristics for the value field.</dd>
  <dt>control</dt>
    <dd>A control structure as described below. It provides control
      characteristics for the value field.</dd>
  <dt>other</dt>
    <dd>Other standard properties can be defined.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In addition the javaIOC structure can have additional fields that support
the value field but are not recognized by most general purpose client tools.
Typical examples are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>input</dt>
    <dd>A field with support that changes the value field. This can be
      anything. It can be a channel access link. It can obtain a value from
      hardware. Etc.</dd>
  <dt>valueAlarm</dt>
    <dd>A field with support that looks for alarm conditions based on the
    value.</dd>
  <dt>output</dt>
    <dd>A field with support that sends the current value
      somewhere else. This can be anything. It can be a channel access link. It
      can write a value to hardware. Etc.</dd>
  <dt>link, links</dt>
    <dd>A structure field that contains one or more fields that are database or
      channel access links to other records and that do not effect the record
      containing the link field. Thus the database or channel access links are
      either process or output links.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The model allows for device records. A device record has fields that are
structures that support the javaIOC data model. For example a power supply
record can have fields power, voltage, current that each support the javaIOC
data model. </p>
<h3>Definitions for Standard Properties</h3>

<p>The set of structures for standard properties for general purpose client
tools are defined in pvData. These are:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>alarm</dt>
       <dd>A structure that has the fields:
       <pre>
structure alarm
    int severity
    int status
    string message
       </pre>
        An alarm also has associated convenience code for processing and displaying alarms.
        In particular the convenience code provides methods that treat <b>severity</b> and <b>status</b>
        like enumerated values.
       </dd>
    <dt>timeStamp</dt>
       <dd>A structure that has the fields:
       <pre>
structure timeStamp
    long secondsPastEpoch
    int nanoSeconds
    int userTag
       </pre>
        A timeStamp also has associated convenience code for processing and displaying timeStamps..
       </dd>
    <dt>display</dt>
       <dd>A structure that has the fields:
       <pre>
structure display
    double limitLow
    double limitHigh
    string description
    string format
    string units
       </pre>
       </dd>
    <dt>control</dt>
       <dd>A structure that has the fields:
       <pre>
structure control
    double limitLow
    double limitHigh
    double minStep
       </pre>
       </dd>
</dl>
<p>See the documentation for either pvDataJava or pvDataCPP for more details about property fields.</p>

<h2>Syntax for pvRequest structure created by createRequest</h2>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> This section is only of interest to someone who is implementing code that
has to introspect a structure generated by createRequest.</p>

<p>pvRequest is a PVStructure that describes 1) record options and 2) field
requests and options. It has the following structure:</p>
<pre>
structure
  structure record
    structure _options
      option
      ...
  structure field
    structure fieldName
      structure _options
        option
        ...
      structure fieldName
        structure _options
          option
          ...
        ...  
  structure putField
    structure fieldName
      structure _options
        option
        ...
      structure fieldName
        structure _options
          option
          ...
        ...  
  structure getField
    structure fieldName
      structure _options
        option
        ...
      structure fieldName
        structure _options
          option
          ...
        ...  
</pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
  <dt>record</dt>
    <dd>The options that apply to the entire record.</dd>
  <dt>option</dt>
    <dd>This is of the form 
      <b>string &lt;name&gt; &lt;value&gt;</b>
    </dd>
  <dt>field</dt>
    <dd>Definitions that select fields of the PVRecord and options for the
      fields. This definition is recursive.</dd>
  <dt>fieldName</dt>
    <dd>The field name that will appear in the PVStructure that is a copy of
      the fields selected from the PVRecord. </dd>
</dl>

<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The definition is recursive , i.e. an arbitarily complex structure can be
    defined.</li>
  <li>If a pvRequest with no fields is specified than all fields if the target
    PVRecord will appear in the PVCopy.</li>
</ul>

<p>An example of option is process.</p>

<p>Process is a record option:</p>
<pre>
structure
  structure record
    structure _options
      string process true
   
</pre>

<p>For example if process is an option to createGet then the record will be
processed before data is fetched. NOTE: scalarType boolean is also
supported.</p>

<p>The following is an example of a field option:</p>
<pre>
structure 
    structure field
        structure value
            structure _options
                string monitorAlgorithm onChange
</pre>

<p>Some examples are:</p>
<pre>
request 
structure 

request alarm,timeStamp,power.value
structure 
    structure alarm
    structure timeStamp
    structure power
        structure value

request record[process=true]field(alarm,timeStamp,power.value)
structure 
    structure record
        structure _options
            string process true
    structure field
        structure alarm
        structure timeStamp
        structure power
            structure value

request record[process=true]field(alarm,timeStamp[algorithm=onChange,causeMonitor=false],power{value,alarm})
structure 
    structure record
        structure _options
            string process true
    structure field
        structure alarm
        structure timeStamp

                string algorithm onChange
                string causeMonitor false
        structure power
            structure value
            structure alarm

request record[process=true,xxx=yyy]field(alarm,timeStamp[causeMonitor=true],power.value)

<h2>Package org.epics.pvioc.pvCopy</h2>
<p>This section describes the Java implementation of pvCopy, which is package
<b>org.epics.pvioc.pvCopy</b>.
It is implemented in
    <a href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvIOCJava/tip/documentation/pvIOCJava.html">
    pvIOCJava.html</a>, 

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This package provides support for copying PVData between a client and
server. For example the client can be a pvAccess client and the server a
pvAccess server. It allows a client to access an arbitrary set of fields of a
PVRecord that exists on the server. This package does not provide support for
transfering the data between client and server but provides support for code
that does, e. g. it can be used by channel access. In the examples below the
data transfer code is called channel access.</p>

<p>This package uses the field offsets provided by PVField and also requires
that user code creates a org.epics.pvdata.misc.BitSet.</p>

<p>PVField provides support for locating a field within a PVStructure or
PVRecord via a field offset. PVField provides the methods:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>getFieldOffset</dt>
    <dd>Get offset of the PVField field within top level structure. Every field
      within the PVStructure has a unique offset. The top level structure has
      an offset of 0. The first field within the structure has offset equal to
      1. The other offsets are determined by recursively traversing each
      structure of the tree.</dd>
  <dt>getNextFieldOffset</dt>
    <dd>Get the next offset. If the field is a scalar or array field then this
      is just offset + 1. If the field is a structure it is the offset of the
      next field after this structure. Thus (nextOffset - offset) is always
      equal to the number of fields within the field. </dd>
  <dt>getNumberFields</dt>
    <dd>Get the total number of fields in this field. This is equal to
      nextFieldOffset - fieldOffset. </dd>
</dl>

<p>A BitSet which has a bit for each field of a top level PVStructure can be
created via:</p>
<pre>    BitSet bitSet = new BitSet(pvStructure.getNumberFields());</pre>

<p>The offsets for bitSet match the fieldOffsets. On the client side of Channel
Access only a BitSet created from the PVStructure is required. On the server
side PVCopy provides a way to map between the field in a PVRecord and the
fields in the PVStructure. A copy of the PVStructure resides on both the
Channel Access client and server. The client and server exchange data via these
two PVStructures. PVCopy maps between the PVStructure and the PVRecord on the
server side of Channel Access. </p>

<p>This package provides the following:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>PVCopy</dt>
    <dd>An interface for mapping between a PVRecord and a PVStructure that
      contains data for a subset of the fields in the PVRecord.</dd>
  <dt>PVCopyMonitor</dt>
    <dd>An interface for monitoring changes to fields of the PVRecord that have
      a corresponding field in PVStructure.</dd>
  <dt>PVCopyFactory</dt>
    <dd>The factory that implements PVCopy. It accepts a PVStructure that
      describes the set of fields of a PVRecord that should be mapped.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>PVCopy</h3>

<p>This is the interface for mapping between a PVStructure that contain a copy
of the data for a subset of the fields in a PVRecord. Note that this interface
is NOT for a single PVStructure but for a single PVRecord and a single
Structure introspection interface that describes a subset of the fields in the
PVRecord. For example if a server supports monitor queues then the server will
allocate a PVStructure for each queue element but will create a single
PVCopy.</p>
<pre>
interface PVCopy {
    PVRecord getPVRecord();
    Structure getStructure();
    PVStructure createPVStructure();
    int getCopyOffset(PVField recordPVField);
    int getCopyOffset(PVStructure recordPVStructure,PVField recordPVField);
    PVField getRecordPVField(int structureOffset);
    void initCopy(PVStructure pvCopy, BitSet bitSet,boolean recordLocked);
    void updateCopySetBitSet(PVStructure copyPVStructure,BitSet bitSet,boolean lockRecord);
    void updateCopyFromBitSet(PVStructure copyPVStructure,BitSet bitSet,boolean lockRecord);
    boolean updateRecord(PVStructure pvCopy,BitSet bitSet,boolean lockRecord);
    PVCopyMonitor createPVCopyMonitor(PVCopyMonitorRequester pvCopyMonitorRequester);
    PVStructure getOptions(PVStructure copyPVStructure,int fieldOffset);
    String dump();
}
</pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
  <dt>getPVRecord</dt>
    <dd>Get the PVRecord to which this PVCopy is attached</dd>
  <dt>getStructure</dt>
    <dd>Get the introspection interface which describes the subset of the
      fields in the PVRecord.</dd>
  <dt>createPVStructure</dt>
    <dd>Create a PVStructure which can hold a subset of the data from the
      PVRecord. A client may require multiple PVStructures. For example if a
      monitor request supports a queue than a PVStructure is required for each
      queue element. </dd>
  <dt>getCopyOffset(PVField recordPVField)</dt>
    <dd>Given a PVField from the record determine the offset within the
      PVStructure where the copy of the data is located.
      PVStructure.getSubField(offset) can be called to locate the PVField
      within the PVStructure. </dd>
  <dt>getCopyOffset(PVStructure recordPVStructure,PVField recordPVField)</dt>
    <dd>Given a recordPVField within a recordPVStructure determine the offset
      within the PVStructure where the copy of the data is located.
      PVStructure.getSubField(offset) can be called to locate the PVField
      within the PVStructure. </dd>
  <dt>getRecordPVField</dt>
    <dd>Given an offset within a PVStructure return the corresponding PVField
      in the PVRecord.</dd>
  <dt>initCopy</dt>
    <dd>Initialize PVStructure with the current data from the PVRecord. The
      bitSet will have offset 0 set to 1 and all other bits set to 0. </dd>
  <dt>updateCopySetBitSet</dt>
    <dd>Update PVStructure from PVRecord. The BitSet shows which fields in
      PVStructure have changed.</dd>
  <dt>updateCopyFromBitSet</dt>
    <dd>Update PVStructure from PVRecord. Only fields that have the offset in
      bitSet set to true are modified.</dd>
  <dt>updateRecord</dt>
    <dd>Update the fields in PVRecord with data from PVStructure. Only fields
      that have the offset in bitSet set to true are modified. </dd>
  <dt>createPVCopyMonitor</dt>
    <dd>Create a PVCopyMonitor. See next section.</dd>
  <dt>getOptions</dt>
    <dd>Get options for a field in a PVStructure created by pvCopy
    The arguments are the pvStructure and the offset of the field for which the options are wanted.
    It returns the options or null if the field did not have options.
    </dd> 
  <dt>dump</dt>
    <dd>Provides a dump of the internal pvCopy nodes. This is useful for debugging
     monitor algorithms.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>PVCopyMonitor</h3>

<p>PVCopyMonitor is a PVListener for the PVRecord to which PVCopy is attached.
It updates two bitSets when it receives PVListener.dataPut callbacks. changeBit
shows all fields that have changed between calls to switchBitSets.
overrunBitSet shows all fields that have changed value more than once between
calls to switchBitSets. It notifies the PVCopyMonitorRequester when data has
changed. </p>
<pre>interface PVCopyMonitorRequester {
    void dataChanged();
    void unlisten();
}

interface PVCopyMonitor {
    void startMonitoring(BitSet changeBitSet, BitSet overrunBitSet);
    void stopMonitoring();
    void switchBitSets(BitSet newChangeBitSet,BitSet newOverrunBitSet, boolean lockRecord);
}</pre>

<p>PVCopyMonitorRequester is the interface implemented by the caller that calls
PVCopy.createPVCopyMonitor:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>dataChanged</dt>
    <dd>Data being monitored has changed.</dd>
  <dt>unlisten</dt>
    <dd>PVCopyMonitor has been told to unlisten so no more monitors will
      occur. </dd>
</dl>

<p>PVCopyMonitor is the interface returned by a call to
PVCopy.createPVCopyMonitor.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>startMonitoring</dt>
    <dd>Start monitoring.</dd>
  <dt>stopMonitoring</dt>
    <dd>Stop monitoring.</dd>
  <dt>switchBitSets</dt>
    <dd>If the pvStructure is not shared all fields that changeBitSet shows
      were changed are copied from the corresponding PVField of the PVRecord to
      the PVField of the PVStructure. Then the bitSets are replaced by the new
      bitSets. Note that a client needs just two instances of the bitSets and
      can just cycle between the two sets. Even if the PVStructure is shared
      this method is important since the caller will not miss data changes. It
      is illegal to call this if startMonitoring was called with no
    arguments.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>PVCopyFactory</h3>

<h4>Java Definition</h4>
<pre>    class PVCopyFactory {
        static PVCopy create(PVRecord pvRecord,PVStructure pvRequest,String structureName);
    }</pre>

<p>create has the arguments</p>
<dl>
  <dt>pvRecord</dt>
    <dd>The PVRecord to which the server is attached.</dd>

<h2>Package org.epics.pvioc.monitor</h2>
<p>This section describes the Java implementation of monitor, which is package
<b>org.epics.pvioc.monitor</b>.
It is implemented in
<a href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvIOCJava/tip/documentation/pvIOCJava.html">
pvIOCJava.html</a>.

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Package org.epics.pvdata.monitor
defines the monitor interfaces as seen by a
client. See that package overview for details.
It is described in
<a href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDataJava/tip/documentation/pvDataJava.html">
pvDataJava.html</a>.
This package implements the
monitoring interfaces for a PVRecord.</p>

<p>The implementation uses PVCopy and PVCopyMonitor which are implemented in
package org.epics.pvioc.pvCopy. When PVCopyMonitor tells monitor that changes
have occurred, monitor applies the appropriate algorithm to each changed field
and if any algorithm says to raise a monitor a monitor is sent to the
client.</p>

<p>This package implements support for the following monitor algorithms: <b>onPut</b>,
<b>onChange</b>, <b>deadband</b>, and <b>periodic</b>.
Each is described in a subsection below.</p>
<p>In addition code for additional monitoring algorithms can be created and registered with the monitoring system.</p>

<h3>onPut</h3>
<p><b>onPut</b> means that a monitor is issued whenever a put is issued to the field.
This is the default unless the record defines a different algorithm for a field.</p>
<p>An exception is the top level timeStamp which by default is made onChange
This is so that a monitor is <b>not</b> a monitor
will not be raised if the only change to fields being monitored is the top level timeStamp.</p>

<h3>onChange</h3>
<p>This provides two options: 1) A monitor is raised whenever a field
changes value, and 2) A monitor will never be raised for the field.
</p>
The client can ask for this option be asking for a field option that specifies the options
<b>algorithm</b> and <b>causeMonitor</b>.
An example is to pass the following request to <b>createRequest</b>.
<pre>
"field(value[algorithm=onChange,causeMonitor=true])"
</pre>
<p>The default for <b>causeMonitor</b> is <b>true</b> so it only has to be specified if the client wants to specify <b>false</b>.
</p>

<h3>deadband</h3>
<p>The field must be a numeric scalar. Whenever the absolute or percentage
value of the field changes by more than a deadband then a monitor is issued.</p>
<p>The complete set of options for deadband are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>algorithm</dt>
    <dd>Thus the client has specified <b>algorithm=deadband</b>
    </dd>
  <dt>deadband</dt>
    <dd>A numeric value</dd>
  <dt>isPercent</dt>
    <dd>This has the value <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>. The default is <b>false</b>.
    This determines if an absolute or percentage change is desired.</dd>
  <dt>type</dt>
    <dd>This must have to value <b>archive</b> or <b>display</b>.
     This is used if the client does not specify a <b>deadband</b> but, as described below, the record does define
     deadbands.
     The default is <b>display</b>.
    </dd>
</dl>
An example is to pass the following request to <b>createRequest</b>.
<pre>
"field(value[algorithm=deadband,deadband=1.0,isPercent=true])"
</pre>
<p>
The record instance can also define the default deadband. For example:</p>
<pre>
record example
    double value
    structure deadband
        structure display
             double value
             boolean isPercent       // optional
        structure archive
             double value
             boolean isPercent       // optional
</pre>


<h3>periodic</h3>
<p>I record will be monitored at a periodic rate if the pvRequest specifies a record option requisting it.
A client can request this by passing the following request to <b>createRequest</b>
<pre>
"record[periodicRate=rate]"
</pre>
<p>where</p>
<dl>
  <dt>rate</dt>
     <dd>This is the rate in seconds.
     For example <b>record[periodicRate=.5]</b>.
     </dd>
</dl>


<p>A monitor is issued at a periodic rate if a put was issued to any field
being monitored.</p>


<h3>Implementing New Monitor Algorithms</h3>

<p>This section discusses how to implement new monitor algorithms in addition
to the onPut, onChange, etc, implemented by this package.</p>

<p>The monitor algorithm must register by calling:</p>
<pre>    MonitorFactory.registerMonitorAlgorithmCreater(MonitorAlgorithmCreate monitorAlgorithmCreate)</pre>

<p>The implementation must implement interfaces <b>MonitorAlgorithmCreate</b>
and <b>MonitorAlgorithm</b> which are described below.</p>

<h4>MonitorFactory</h4>

<p>This is a request to create a monitor.</p>
<pre>class MonitorFactory {
    static Monitor create(PVRecord pvRecord,
        MonitorRequester monitorRequester,PVStructure pvRequest);
    static void registerMonitorAlgorithmCreater(MonitorAlgorithmCreate monitorAlgorithmCreate)
}</pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
  <dt>create</dt>
    <dd>Create a monitor. The arguments are: 
      <dl>
        <dt>pvRecord</dt>
          <dd>The record being monitored.</dd>
        <dt>monitorRequester</dt>
          <dd>The monitor requester. This is the code to which monitot events
            will be delivered.</dd>
        <dt>pvRequest</dt>
          <dd>The request options</dd>
      </dl>
    </dd>
  <dt><b>registerMonitorAlgorithmCreater</b></dt>
    <dd>Called by code that implements a monitor algorithm.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>MonitorAlgorithm</h4>

<p>The following must be implemented by code that implements a monitor
algorithm.</p>
<pre>
interface MonitorAlgorithm  {
    String getAlgorithmName();
    boolean causeMonitor();
    void monitorIssued();
}</pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
  <dt>getAlgorithmName</dt>
    <dd>return the name of the algorithm.</dd>
  <dt>causeMonitor</dt>
    <dd>Called to see if a change to this field should cause a monitor</dd>
  <dt>monitorIssued</dt>
    <dd>Called after a monitor has been issued.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>MonitorAlgorithmCreate</h4>

<p>The following must be implemented by code that implements a monitor
algorithm.</p>
<pre>
interface MonitorAlgorithmCreate {
    String getAlgorithmName();
    MonitorAlgorithm create(
            PVRecord pvRecord,
            MonitorRequester monitorRequester,
            PVField fromPVRecord,
            PVStructure pvOptions);
}
</pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
  <dt>getAlgorithmName</dt>
    <dd>return the name of the algorithm.</dd>
  <dt>create</dt>
    <dd>Create a new instance of the algorithm.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>pvDatabaseCPP</h2>
<p>This implements the following:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>channelProviderLocal</dt>
     <dd>A complete implementation of channel provider.
      This is called by the server side of remote pvAccess,</dd>
   <dt>pvCopy and monitor</dt>
     <dd>Like what pvIOCJava provides but there is no support for monitor algorithms.</dd>
   <dt>database</dt>
     <dd>It supports records but unlike pvIOCJava there is no
     support for fields. There is a single process method for a record.</dd>
</dl>
</dl>
