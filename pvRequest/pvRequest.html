<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>pvAccess: pvRequest argument</h3>
<p><b>pvAccess</b> defines interface <b>Channel</b>,
which is a connection between a client and a server.
<b>Channel</b> has a number of create methods.
Each has an argument <b>pvRequest</b>:
</p>
<pre>
NOTE: The following is pseudo code.
ChannelProcess createChannelProcess(
    ChannelProcessRequester channelProcessRequester,
    PVStructure pvRequest);
ChannelGet createChannelGet(
    ChannelGetRequester channelGetRequester,
    PVStructure pvRequest);
ChannelPut createChannelPut(
    ChannelPutRequester channelPutRequester,
    PVStructure pvRequest);
ChannelPutGet createChannelPutGet(
    ChannelPutGetRequester channelPutGetRequester,
    PVStructure pvRequest);
ChannelRPC createChannelRPC(
    ChannelRPCRequester channelRPCRequester,
    PVStructure pvRequest);
ChannelArray createChannelArray(
    ChannelArrayRequester channelArrayRequester,
    PVStructure pvRequest);
Monitor createMonitor(
    MonitorRequester MonitorRequester,
    PVStructure pvRequest);
</pre>
<h3>terminology</h3>
<dl>
   <dt>channel access</dt>
   <dd>
      This refers to both the client API and network protocol that has existed since the last
       half of the 1980's.
       <br />
      It is used by clients to communicate with the runtime database of DBRecords in an IOC.
   </dd>
   <dt>pva</dt>
   <dd>
       This is the V4 channel provider.
       This includes:
        <dl>
            <dt>network protocol</dt>
              <dd>
                 A network protocol that passes <b>PVStructure</b> data between client and server.
               </dd>

            <dt>provider API</dt>
                <dd>
                  An API for use by channel providers.
                 A provider can exist on either the client or server.

        </dl>
   </dd>
   <dt>ca</dt>
   <dd>
       This is a client side provider that uses the <b>channel access</b> network protocol.

   <dt>qsrv</dt>
   <dd>
       This is a server side provider that provides access to DBRecords.
   </dd>
</dl>
<h3>brief history of pvRequest</h3>
<p>In 2006 a project named <b>javaIOC</b> was started by Marty Kraimer.
Shortly after Matej Sekoranja also started working on this project.
Until about 2000, they were the only <b>javaIOC</b> developers.
</p>
<p>
The pvAccess API was one of the first projects.
How to pass client requests to the  server was a big problem.
Then it was agreed that, since pvData supports structured data,
a single argument can be used to pass client requests to the server, i.e.
</p>
<pre>
PVStructure pvRequest
</pre>
<p><b>pvRequest</b> allows a client to pass structured data to the server.
But without something more servers and tools would not know what to do with a pvRequest structure.
Thus a facility <b>CreateRequest</b> was created.
It takes a <b>request</b> string and creates a <b>pvRequest</b>.
</p>
<p>
In about 2000 work started on a C++ implementation of what was in the javaIOC.
At this time more people became involved with develpment.
This is now what is called the <b>EPICS 7</b> <b>V4</b> modules.
Both Java, C++, and Python implementations are now provided.
</p>
<h3>createRequest</h3>
<p><b>pvAcccess</b> does not define the format of a <b>pvRequest</b> but <b>pvData</b> does
provide a convenience method:</p>
<pre>
PVStructure createRequest(String request);
</pre>
This creates a <b>pvRequest</b> that can be used to communicate with a server.
<p>
pvDataCPP and pvDataJava both implement <b>CreateRequest</b>.
</p>
<p>
A pvRequest structure allows a client to select:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>an arbitrary set of fields.</dt>
      <dd>
        When a client connects to  channel, it receives a <b>Structure</b> that describes the
        <b>PVStructure</b> the channel supports.
        From the <b>Structure</b>, or just by anticipating what the server supports,
        the client can select the fields it wants to use.
      </dd>
      <dt>global and field specific options</dt>
      <dd>
         The client can pass global and field specific options to the server.
         <br />
         An option is just a <b>name,value</b> pair, where both name and value are a string.
      </dd>
</dl>
<h3>client guidelines</h3>
<p>When a client connects to a channel, the client callback has a  <b>Structure</b> argument.
The <b>Structure</b> is the introspection interface for the <b>PVStructure</b> associated with the channel.
The client can use <b>Structure</b> to select the fields it wants to get, put, monitor, etc.
</p>
<p>
Another way is for the client to guess which fields the channel supports.
This is what most clients will do.
For example a widget for a display manager knows which fields it requires.
</p>
<p>The server may provide a different set of fields then the client requests.
When a get, put, etc, connects the client code must be prepared to accept what the server provides.
</p>
<h3>server guidelines</h3>
<p>A server only provides fields it supports for the operation, e. g. get, put.
If it does not support any fields the client requests then it should return an error.
</p>
<p>The server looks for record and field options it supports,
and just ignores other options.
</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>pvAccess provides the ability to pass structured data between clients and servers.
Since the data can be quite complex it could be very difficult for clients to use.
Lets consider a few typical types of clients.</p>
<h3>client tools</h3>
<p>Tools like CSS caqtDM, etc., provide widgets like strip chart , alarm display, slider, etc.
These widgets want data like EPICS base provides.
That means some combination of <b>value</b>, <b>alarm</b>, <b>timeStamp</b>,
<b>display</b>, and <b>control</b> information.
</p>
<h3>channelPutGet services</h3>
<p>A service that is implemented via a channelPutGet request could provide data via a structure like:</p>
<pre>
structure recordName
    structure argument
       // details are service specific
    structure result
       // details are service specific
</pre>
where
<dl>
   <dt>argument</dt>
     <dd>Data sent by client</dd>
   <dt>result</dt>
     <dd>Data returned to the client from the service.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In this case the client could just say that it wants <b>"putField(argument),getField(result)"</b>
</p>
<h3>normative type support</h3>
<p>There is automatic support for some normative types like NTScalar and NTArray.
Other normative types could provide helper code that either uses the conventions and support described
in this document or invent their own support for creating a pvRequest.</p>
<h3>other specialized support</h3>
<p>For specialized support it is always possible to create private conventions for pvRequest.
But then general pupose tools will be much less useful
and it may also be necessary for the support to implement various Channel methods.</p>


<h2>Create Request</h2>
<h3>where defined</h3>
<p><b>pvData</b> (both pvDataJava and pvDataCPP) have a convenience class with a method <b>createRequest</b>.
For example pvDataJava has:</p>
<pre>
public class CreateRequestFactory {
   public static PVStructure createRequest(String request)
}
</pre>
<h3>purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose is to create a pvRequest structures for accesssing data in a server.
It allows the clients to select an arbitrary subset of the fields in the top level structure
associated with the channel.
It also allows the client to specify options.
Thus the client can specify:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>desired fields</dt>
     <dd>An arbitrary set of fields can be specified.</dd>
   <dt>global options</dt>
    <dd>Global options are options that apply to the record itself.</dd>
  <dt>field options</dt>
     <dd>These are options that apply to a field.
      </dd>
</dl>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> The term record is adapted from pvDatabase. A pvDatabase is database of
a memory resident <b>smart</b> records.
A pvAcccess channel is a connection to a record.
A record has a top level <b>PVStructure</b> that holds the data for the record.
</p>
<p>
Other pvAcccess providers must provide a <b>PVStructure</b> for each channel it supports.
</p>
<p>
<b>qsrv</b> is a channel provider for iocCore <b>DBRecord</b>s.
</p>
<h3>syntax</h3>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> an appendix has a <b>BNF</b> description of request.
<br />
This section provides an easier (hopefully) to understand description.
</p>
<p>A request argument has the syntax:</p>
<pre>
record[option,...]field(fieldDef,...)
OR
field(fieldDef,...)
OR
fieldDef,...
OR
record[option,...]putField(fieldDef,...)getField(fieldDef,...)
OR
putField(fieldDef,...)getField(fieldDef,...)
</pre>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An empty string is also valid. It is the same as <b>field()</b>.</li>
    <li>Order is important, e. g. record can not appear after field.</li>
    <li>The following:
<pre>
field()
getField()
putField()
</pre>
       all mean an entire data structure.
      </li>
</ul> 
<p>Thus a request consists of record options and sets of field definitions or
just field definitions. A record option is of the form:</p>
<pre>
record[name=value,...]
</pre>

<p>A <b>field(...)</b>,<b>getField(...)</b>,<b>putField(...)</b> is a comma separated set of <b>fieldDefs</b>
which are of
the form:</p>
<pre>
fullFieldName
or
fullFieldName[option,...]
or
fullFieldName{fieldDef,...}     // recursive definition
or
fullFieldName[option,...]{fieldDef,...}     // recursive definition
</pre>

<p><b>fullFieldName</b> selects a subfield of the current sub-structure being accessed.
Initially this means the top level structure of the data associated with the channel.
In a recursive definition the current sub-structure becomes the location asscociated with fullFieldName
</p>
<p>If
<b>fieldName{fieldDef,...}</b> is given then the generated data structure will have
a structure field with subfields.</p>


<p>The syntax was chosen to be easy to use and to parse:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>record[...]</dt>
      <dd>
      Specifies a set of global options, i. e., options that apply to the record itself. 
      </dd>
   <dt>field(...)</dt>
   <dt>putField(...)</dt>
   <dt>getField(...)</dt>
      <dd>
      Each selects a set of subfields of the top level structure.
      Each specifies a comma separated set of <b>fieldDef</b>s.
      </dd>
   <dt>fieldDef</dt>
     <dd>Selects a single subfield of the current structure.</dd>
   <dt>option</dt>
      <dd>
      A <b>name=value</b> pair. Both <b>name</b> and <b>value</b> are character strings.
      </dd>
   <dt>[...]</dt>
      <dd>
      Holds a comma separated set of <b>option</b>s.
      </dd>
   <dt>{...}</dt>
      <dd>
      Selects a set of subfields of a substructure within the top level structure.
      Each defines a comma separated set of <b>fieldDef</b>s.
      This is a recursive definition.
      Thus a <b>fullFieldName</b> within <b>{}</b> is relative to structure that is referenced
      by <b>{}</b>.
      </dd>
</dl>
<h4>naming conventions</h4>
<dl>
  <dt>blanks</dt>
      <dd>All blanks are removed before parsing is started.</dd>
   <dt>reserved characters</dt>
      <dd>The following characters may not be used except as used in the above syntax:
<pre>
{ } ( ) [ ] = ,
</pre>
       <br />
       The character <b>'.'</b> in a <b>fieldDef</b> separates field names.
      </dd>
    <dt>field name</dt>
       <dd>
       A field name can only contain alphanumeric characters and the character <b>'_'</b>,
       but must not start with the character <b>'_'</b>.
       <br />
       This is not enforced by the current parser but should be a rule for field names.
       </dd>
    <dt>option name</dt>
      <dd>This should follow the same convertion as field name.
       <br />
       This is not enforced by the parser but future changes could.
      </dd>
   <dt>option value</dt>
       <dd>For now the only illegal characters are the reserved characters.
        <br />
        Alphanumeric characters are valid.
        <br />
        The characters <b>':'</b> and <b>'?'</b> are also valid.
        <br />
        What other characters should be allowed?
      </dd>

</dl>


<p>
Thus a request consists of record options and sets of field definitions or
just field definitions.
<br />
A record option is of the form:</p>
<pre>
record[name=value,...]
</pre>

<p><b>field</b>,<b>putFeld</b>, and <b>getField</b> each contain a comma separated set of fieldDefs which are of
the form:</p>
<pre>
fullFieldName
or 
fullFieldName[option,...]
or 
fullFieldName{request}     // recursive definition
</pre>

<p>A <b>fullFieldName</b> is the full name of a field in the PVRecord.
</p>

<p>If request is null or an empty string than an entire structure is selected.</p>

<p>The syntax was chosen to be easy to use and to parse:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>record[]</dt>
      <dd>
      Specifies a set of global options, i. e., options that apply to the record itself. 
      </dd>
   <dt>field()</dt>
   <dt>putField()</dt>
   <dt>getField()</dt>
      <dd>
      Each selects a set of subfields of the top level structure.
      Each defines a comma separated set of <b>fieldDef</b>s.
      </dd>
   <dt>fieldDef</dt>
     <dd>Selects a single subfield of the current structure.</dd>
   <dt>option</dt>
      <dd>
      A <b>name=value</b> pair. Both <b>name</b> and <b>value</b> are character strings.
      </dd>
   <dt>[]</dt>
      <dd>
      Holds a comma separated set of <b>option</b>s.
      </dd>
   <dt>{}</dt>
      <dd>
      Selects a set of subfields of a substructure within the top level structure.
      Each defines a comma separated set of <b>fieldDef</b>s.
      This is a recursive definition.
      Thus a <b>fullFieldName</b> within <b>{}</b> is relative to structure that is referenced
      by <b>{}</b>.
      </dd>
</dl>
<h3>examples</h3>

</pre>

<h2>Existing Options</h2>
<p>Some record options, but no field options, are officialy supported. 
The next section describe possible field options.
</p>
<p>At present the following record options are supported:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>queueSize</dt>
     <dd>
      This is used to define the queueSize for monitors.
      The default is:
<pre>
record[queueSize=2]
</pre>
      A larger size can be specified.
     </dd>
    <dt>process</dt>
     <dd>
      This is used by <b>qsrv</b> and <b>pvDatabase</b> to specify if records should be processed.
      The default is <b>false</b> for channelGet and <b>true</b> for channelPut and channelPutGet.
      <br />
       An example is:
<pre>
record[process=false]
</pre>
     </dd>
    <dt>block</dt>
     <dd>
      This is used to specify if a request to process a record should
      block until the record completes processing.
      The default is the same as the value of the  <b>process</b> option.
      An example is:
<pre>
record[block=false]
</pre>
     </dd>
</dl>
<h2>pvRequest compliance</h2>
<h3>pvDatabase</h3>
<p>
<b>pvDatabaseCPP</b> and <b>pvDatabaseJava</b> are complient with <b>pvRequest</b> including record options.
The latest <b>epics-base</b> repositories do not support any field options.
However see below for a <b>pvDatabaseCPP</b> implementation that does support field options.
</p> 
<h3>ca provider</h3>
<p><b>ca</b> is a client provider that uses the <b>channel access</b> network protocol,
but presents data to the client as <b>pvData</b> structures.
</p>
<p>
The latest version of <b>ca</b> in <b>pvAccessCPP</b> has <b>pvRequest</b> support that
allows the client to select a combination of
of <b>value</b>, <b>alarm</b>, <b>timeStamp</b>,
<b>display</b>, <b>control</b>, and <b>valueAlarm</b> information.
<br />
But there are some problems.
Hopefully these will be fixed.
</p>
<h3>qsrv</h3>
<p><b>qsrv</b> is not complient with <b>pvRequest</b>
<br />
For example:
</p>
<pre>
mrk> pvget -p ca -r "value" -i DBRdouble
DBRdouble
structure 
    double value 0
mrk> pvget -p pva -r "value" -i DBRdouble
DBRdouble
epics:nt/NTScalar:1.0 
    double value 0
    alarm_t alarm
        int severity 3
        int status 2
        string message UDF
    time_t timeStamp
        long secondsPastEpoch 631152000
        int nanoseconds 0
        int userTag 0
    display_t display
        double limitLow -10
        double limitHigh 10
        string description 
        string format 
        string units volts
    control_t control
        double limitLow -9
        double limitHigh 9
        double minStep 0
    valueAlarm_t valueAlarm
        boolean active false
        double lowAlarmLimit -8
        double lowWarningLimit -6
        double highWarningLimit 6
        double highAlarmLimit 8
        int lowAlarmSeverity 0
        int lowWarningSeverity 0
        int highWarningSeverity 0
        int highAlarmSeverity 0
        double hysteresis 0
</pre>
<h2>pvDatabase: Proposed plugin support</h2>
<p>This section describes a set of proposed field options for pvDatabase,
but first a brief description of channel filters is provided.
The channel filters were the inspiration for many of the proposed field options.
Next a brief description of an implementation of filters for PVRecords is provided.
A client makes requests via field options.
Finally a set of proposed options is described.
</p>
<h3>iocCore channel filters</h3>
<p>Beginning with the 3.15 releases of <b>epics-base</b>
channel filters are supported.
Currently there is support for <b>TimeStamp</b>, <b>Deadband</b>, <b>Array</b>, and <b>Synchronize</b>.
In addition code can be written to support other plugins without requiring any changes to <b>epics-base</b>.
</p>
<p>
Using the <b>channel access</b> client API, the client requests plugins by appending to the channel name.
<br />
For example:
</p>
<pre>
caget test:channel 'test:channel.{"arr":{"s":2,"i":2,"e":8}}' test:channel.[3:5] test:channel.[3:2:-3]
 test:channel 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
 test:channel.{"arr":{"s":2,"i":2,"e":8}} 4 2 4 6 8
 test:channel.[3:5] 3 3 4 5
 test:channel.[3:2:-3] 3 3 5 7
</pre>
<p>Some observations about the channel filters:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>channel access does not provide for client options</dt>
    <dd>
      The client API allows the client to choose one of the <b>DBR_...</b>
      data types. It does not provide for client specific options.
    </dd>
  <dt>client specifies filter by appending to the  channel name</dt>
    <dd>
     Since the client API does not provide client specific options,
     this is the only way to specify options.
   </dd>
  <dt>channel filters only make sense for value field</dt>
   <dd>
    Filters only make sense for field <b>VAL</b>, which is the default field if no field name is specified.
   </dd>
   <dt>current implementation does not connect if client gives an incorrect request</dt>
     <dd>
<pre>
mrk> caget DBRdoubleArray.[2:4]
DBRdoubleArray.[2:4] 3 3 4 5
mrk> caget DBRdoubleArray.[xxx:yyy]
Channel connect timed out: 'DBRdoubleArray.[xxx:yyy]' not found.
</pre>
     </dd>
    <dt>current implementation does not work for put</dt>
       <dd>
<pre>
mrk> caget DBRdoubleArray.[2:4]
DBRdoubleArray.[2:4] 3 3 4 5
mrk> caput DBRdoubleArray.[2:4] 3 10 20 30
Old : DBRdoubleArray.[2:4] 3 3 4 5
New : DBRdoubleArray.[2:4] 3 3 0 0
mrk> caget DBRdoubleArray.[2:4]
DBRdoubleArray.[2:4] 3 2.50321e-308 0 0
</pre>
      </dd>
</dl>
<h3>pvDatabase plugin support</h3>
<p>
<a
href="https://github.com/mrkraimer/pvDatabaseCPP">pvDatabaseCPPMRK
</a>
implements support for plugins.
It does that via the <b>pvCopy</b> facility.
</p>
<p>
 <b>pvCopy</b> is implemented in pvData.
<b>pvDatabaseCPPMRK</b> has a local version of <b>pvCopy</b> which has been modified to support plugins.
It currently has support for <b>array</b>, <b>deadband</b> , and <b>timeStamp</b> similar to what
iocCore filter implements.
Since <b>pvCopy</b> implements the support,
PVRecord code does not have to know about the plugins.
</p>
<p>Other plugins can be created and registered with the plugin support.
</p>
<p>Instead of a client requesting plugins via info appended to the channel name,
the client specifies field options.
<br />
For example:

<h3>array plugin</h3>
<p>
This  filter is used to retrieve parts of an array (subarrays and strided subarrays).
It is modeled after the iocCore array channel filter.
</p>
<p>
This filter works for both get and put.
It works for any scalarArray field.
It has not been tested for structureArray or unionArray fields.
</p>
<p>The syntax is one of the following:</p>
<pre>
[array=start]
[array=start:end]
[array=start:increment:end]
</pre>
<p>
<b>start</b> and <b>end</b> both specify an index.
<b>increment</b> must be a positive integer.
</p>
<p>
<b>start</b> and <b>end</b> can be a positive or negative integer.
If negative it is relative to the end of the array with -1 meaning the last element.
</p>
<p>Suppose that the master array is:</p>
<pre>
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
</pre>
<p>Then the get request</p>
<pre>
[array=0:4]
</pre>
gets
<pre>
1,2,3,4,5
</pre>
The request:
<pre>
[array=-3:-1]
</pre>
gets
<pre>
8,9,10
</pre>
The request:
<pre>
[array=2:5]
</pre>
gets
<pre>
3,4,5,6
</pre>
The request:
<pre>
[array=0:2:-1]
</pre>
gets
<pre>
1,3,5,7,9
</pre>
<h3>deadband plugin</h3>
<p>
This filter is used to limit the changes to a numeric scalar field that are reported to a client.
It is modeled after the iocCore deadband channel filter.
</p>
<p>
This filter only works for numeric scalar fields and only for toCopy.
</p>
<p>The syntax is one of the following:</p>
<pre>
[deadband=abs:value]
[deadband=rel:value]
</pre>
where
<dl>
   <dt>abs</dt>
    <dd>The amount value must change since the last value the client received.</dd>
   <dt>rel</dt>
     <dd>
       The percentage amount the value must change since the last value the client received. 
     </dd>
</dl>
<h3>timeStamp plugin</h3>
<p>
This filter is used for accessing a timeStamp field. 
It is modeled after the iocCore timeStamp channel filter.
</p>
<p>
This filter only works for a timeStamp field.
</p>
<p>The syntax is one of the following:</p>
<pre>
[timestamp=current]
[timestamp=copy]
</pre>
where
<dl>
  <dt>current</dt>
     <dd>
      Only works for toCopy=true.
      Instead of taking the timestamp from master the timeStamp for the client is set to
      the current time.
     </dd>
   <dt>copy</dt>
     <dd>
      Only works for toCopy=false.
      The timestamp in master is set equal to the timeStamp from the client.
     </dd>
</dl>
<h3>ignore plugin</h3>
<p>This is not an actual plugin but is handled by pvCopy itself.
It is used to suppress sending data to a client unless other fields have changed.
</p>
<p>The syntax is:</p>
<pre>
[ignore=true]
</pre>

<h2>Appendix I: Description of the PVStructure created by createRequest</h2>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> This section is only of interest to someone who is implementing code that
has to introspect a structure generated by createRequest.</p>

<p>pvRequest is a PVStructure that describes 1) record options and 2) field
requests and options. It has the following structure:</p>
<pre>
structure
  structure record
    structure _options
      option
      ...
  structure field
    structure fieldName
      structure _options
        option
        ...
      structure fieldName
        structure _options
          option
          ...
        ...  
  structure putField
    structure fieldName
      structure _options
        option
        ...
      structure fieldName
        structure _options
          option
          ...
        ...  
  structure getField
    structure fieldName
      structure _options
        option
        ...
      structure fieldName
        structure _options
          option
          ...
        ...  
</pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
  <dt>record</dt>
    <dd>The options that apply to the entire record.</dd>
  <dt>option</dt>
    <dd>This is of the form 
      <b>string &lt;name&gt; &lt;value&gt;</b>
    </dd>
  <dt>field</dt>
    <dd>Definitions that select fields of the PVRecord and options for the
      fields. This definition is recursive.</dd>
  <dt>fieldName</dt>
    <dd>The field name that will appear in the PVStructure that is a copy of
      the fields selected from the PVRecord. </dd>
</dl>

<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The definition is recursive , i.e. an arbitarily complex structure can be
    defined.</li>
  <li>If a pvRequest with no fields is specified than all fields if the target
    PVRecord will appear in the PVCopy.</li>
</ul>

<p>An example of option is process.</p>

<p>Process is a record option:</p>
<pre>
structure
  structure record
    structure _options
      string process true
   
</pre>

<p>For example if process is an option to createGet then the record will be
processed before data is fetched. NOTE: scalarType boolean is also
supported.</p>

<p>The following is an example of a field option:</p>
<pre>
structure 
    structure field
        structure value
            structure _options
                string monitorAlgorithm onChange
</pre>

<p>Some examples are:</p>
<pre>
request 
structure 

request alarm,timeStamp,power.value
structure 
    structure alarm
    structure timeStamp
    structure power
        structure value

request record[process=true]field(alarm,timeStamp,power.value)
structure 
    structure record
        structure _options
            string process true
    structure field
        structure alarm
        structure timeStamp
        structure power
            structure value

request record[process=true]field(alarm,timeStamp[algorithm=onChange,causeMonitor=false],power{value,alarm})
structure 
    structure record
        structure _options
            string process true
    structure field
        structure alarm
        structure timeStamp
            structure _options
                string algorithm onChange
                string causeMonitor false
        structure power
            structure value
            structure alarm

request record[process=true,xxx=yyy]field(alarm,timeStamp[causeMonitor=true],power.value)
structure 
    structure record
        structure _options
            string process true
            string xxx yyy
    structure field
        structure alarm
        structure timeStamp
            structure _options
                string causeMonitor true
        structure power
            structure value

<h2>Appendix II: V4 Property Definitions</h2>
<p>
This is not directly related to <b>pvRequest</b>.
However it does impact various V4 modules so it is briefly mentioned here.
</p>
<h3>enum</h3>
<pre>
enum_t value
    int index 0
    string[] 
</pre>
<p>Look OK.</p>
<h3>alarm</h3>
<pre>
alarm_t alarm
    int severity
    int status
    string message
</pre>
<p>Looks OK.</p>
<h3>timeStamp</h3>
<pre>
time_t timeStamp
    long secondsPastEpoch
    int nanoseconds
    int userTag
</pre>
<p>Looks OK.</p>
<h3>control</h3>
<pre>
control_t control
    double limitLow
    double limitHigh
    double minStep
</pre>
<p>Looks OK.</p>
<h3>display</h3>
<pre>
display_t display
    double limitLow
    double limitHigh
    string description 
    string format 
    string units
</pre>
<p><b>format</b> is a problem but what to do?
</p>
<h3>valueAlarm</h3>
<pre>
valueAlarm_t valueAlarm
    boolean active
    double lowAlarmLimit
    double lowWarningLimit
    double highWarningLimit
    double highAlarmLimit
    int lowAlarmSeverity
    int lowWarningSeverity
    int highWarningSeverity
    int highAlarmSeverity
    double hysteresis
</pre>
<p>The above is OK.
But there is a version for each numeric type.
Note that <b>control</b> and <b>display</b> only have double for limit fields.
<br />
Perhaps the same should be true for <b>valueAlarm</b>.
